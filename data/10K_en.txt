Agenda item 22
THE SITUATION OF DEMOCRACY AND
HUMAN RIGHTS IN HAITI
Report of the Secretary-General
1. The present report is a follow-up to the report dated 12 July 1993 (A/47/975-S/26063) by which the Secretary-General informed the Security Council of the signature of the Governors Island Agreement.
It is being submitted in pursuance of paragraph 15 of Security Council resolution 841 (1993) of 16 June 1993, in which the Council requested the Secretary-General to report to it on progress achieved in the efforts jointly undertaken by him and the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States (OAS) with a view to reaching a political solution to the crisis Haiti.
2. Following the signature of the Governors Island Agreement on 3 July 1993, Mr. Dante Caputo, the Special Envoy of the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and OAS, invited the representatives of the main political forces in Haiti and of the political blocs in Parliament to participate, together with the members of the Presidential Commission which represents President Aristide in Haiti, at a political dialogue to discuss the agenda set forth in point 1 of the Governors Island Agreement.
3. The inter-Haitian political dialogue convened at United Nations Headquarters from 14 to 16 July 1993.
At its conclusion the participants signed a new document, known as the New York Pact, which provides for a political truce of six months' duration, a procedure to enable Parliament to resume its normal functioning, and agreements for the early confirmation of the Prime Minister nominated by the President to head a Government of national concord, and for the adoption of the legal instruments necessary for ensuring the transition. (The text of the New York Pact is reproduced in the annex to the present report.)
4. Under the Pact, the political forces and parliamentary blocs have undertaken inter alia to refrain from tabling in Parliament any motion of no-confidence against the new Government of national concord, to secure the immediate release of all persons detained for offences relating to their views (délits d'opinion) and to have the status of prisoners reviewed, to promote the establishment of a Compensation Commission for the victims of the coup d'état, and to ensure the confirmation of the new Prime Minister without delay. 93-44925 (E) 130893 /... English
Page 5. The signatories of the Pact have also undertaken to ensure the passage by Parliament of a series of bills under an emergency procedure, including those regarding the establishment of a new police force, an amnesty, the abolition of all paramilitary forces, the establishment of a Citizens' Protection Bureau, and the reform of the administration of justice system.
6. The Pact reaffirms the right of the Executive, within the framework of its powers, to review the various decrees and orders adopted in the period from 30 September 1991 to 3 July 1993 that are not in accordance with the Constitution, in particular, the order setting up the Permanent Emergency Electoral Council.
7. As regards the 13 Members of Parliament who derived their mandate from the partial elections held on 18 January 1993, which had been declared illegitimate by the General Assembly in its resolution 47/20 B of 20 April 1993 and by the Permanent Council of OAS, it was agreed that they should voluntarily refrain from occupying their parliamentary seats until such time as the Conciliation Commission, an organ established under the Constitution but whose functioning requires the adoption by Parliament of a law under the emergency procedure, had definitively pronounced itself on the matter.
8. It is the understanding of the Secretary-General that the formula agreed to under paragraph 6 of the Pact signifies that the members of the Senate and of the Chamber of Deputies who derive their mandate from the contested elections of 18 January 1993 are to abstain from participating in any business of the Parliament, including intervention in the debate and voting.
Failure to comply with this formula would constitute, in his view, a serious breach of the Governors Island Agreement, which would be immediately reported to the Security Council.
The Secretary-General further considers that the decision to refer the matter to the Conciliation Commission is not based upon any finding that there exists any conflict between the Executive and the Legislature or between the two Chambers of Parliament, but is a product of a political agreement to overcome an exceptional crisis.
During the political dialogue, the Special Envoy repeated that the position of the United Nations with regard to the legitimacy of the January elections remained unchanged.
9. The undertakings enshrined in the Pact, like all agreements arrived at under the Governors Island Agreement, are subject to verification by the United Nations and by OAS.
10. The Secretary-General wishes to express his appreciation for the efforts undertaken during the inter-Haitian political dialogue by the Governments of Canada, France, the United States of America and Venezuela as "Friends of the Secretary-General", and on whose continued assistance he is relying during the implementation phase of the agreements.
11. On 24 July 1993, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide informed the Presidents of the two Chambers of Parliament of his intention to nominate Mr. Robert Malval as Prime Minister.
A new bureau was elected in the Chamber of Deputies on 22 and 28 July and in the Senate on 10 August.
With the normalization of Parliament, the way has been cleared for the ratification of the Prime Minister.
When the new Prime Minister receives a vote of confidence from the two Chambers of Parliament, the three first points in the Governors Island Agreement will have been duly carried out.
12. As soon as the Prime Minister has taken office, the Secretary-General, as proposed in his previous report (A/47/975-S/26063) and agreed in the letter addressed to him by the President of the Security Council on 15 July 1993 (S/26085), will recommend to the Security Council that the sanctions it imposed by resolution 841 (1993) should immediately be suspended.
The suspension will automatically be terminated and sanctions reimposed if at any time he, having regard to the view of the Secretary-General of OAS, reports to the Council that the parties to the Governors Island Agreement or any authorities in Haiti have failed to comply in good faith with the Agreement.
Some of the circumstances which would lead the Secretary-General to conclude that such a breach had occurred are spelt out in paragraph 8 above and in paragraph 11 of his previous report.

(vi) Act on territorial authorities;
(vii) Act on the prison administration;
(viii) Act concerning the establishment, organization and operation of the Conciliation Commission;

The United Nations and OAS undertake, by making two experts available, to make a technical and juridical contribution to the preparation of the Act establishing the Conciliation Commission and to its implementation.
It has also been agreed that the Conciliation Commission shall be the only body in the country called upon to pronounce definitively on this issue.

Deployment of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus,
I. INTRODUCTION
The Security Council, in its resolution 186 (1964) of 4 March 1964 (S/5575), recommended that the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) be established and that the Force be stationed for a period of three months with a mandate to use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of fighting, and, as necessary, to contribute to the maintenance and restoration of law and order and a return to normal conditions.
The Council also recommended that all costs pertaining to the Force should be met in a manner to be agreed upon by the Governments providing the contingents and by the Government of Cyprus.
The Secretary-General was also authorized to accept voluntary contributions for that purpose.
Thus, UNFICYP became unique among United Nations peace-keeping operations in depending on voluntary contributions to meet the cost of its operation.
The United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus became operational on 27 March 1964.
During the first four years of the Force, mandate extensions by the Security Council were mostly for three-month periods.
Thereafter, the mandate of UNFICYP has been extended for six-month periods, the latest of which was extended by Security Council resolution 839 (1993) of 11 June 1993 from 16 June to 15 December 1993.
The present report sets out the operational plan of the Force, and the cost estimates for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 16 June to 15 December 1993.
It also provides the historical background for the period from inception through 15 June 1993 on the financing of the Force, its financial administration, the voluntary contributions received and the status of reimbursements due to troop-contributing countries.
II. OPERATIONAL PLAN
The Security Council, in its resolution 831 (1993) of 27 May 1993 decided that UNFICYP should be restructured to a strength of three infantry battalions of approximately 350 personnel each, the minimum number required to maintain effective control of the buffer zone, with the addition of a limited number of military observers for reconnaissance.
The operational plan for UNFICYP, at the present stage, as called for by Council resolution 831 (1993), is described below.
The main headquarters of the mission, which was located at Nicosia since the inception of UNFICYP, will continue to be based in the United Nations Protected Area, Nicosia.
For operational purposes, UNFICYP will be divided into three sectors and six line companies.
Until recently, the three sectors were covered by battalions provided by Austria, Canada and the United Kingdom, with each battalion comprising two line companies together with headquarters and first line support.
The Canadian battalion has since withdrawn and a replacement battalion of some 350 personnel, to be drawn from a new troop-contributor, is expected to arrive by 1 September 1993.
It is envisaged that Sector West will be responsible for the area from Kokkina to the Ovgos River.
Sector Centre will be responsible for the area covering Nicosia and Sector East will be responsible for the area from Nicosia to the east coast.
An armoured squadron and a helicopter flight unit will be based in the United Nations Protected Area.
The main functions of the Force have been to maintain the military status quo and to use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of fighting.
These functions will continue and under normal conditions, they will be carried out through the use of permanent and temporary observation posts along with helicopter, vehicle and foot patrols in the buffer zone.
In addition, UNFICYP also conducts, supervises as necessary, encourages and facilitates such humanitarian and economic activities that may be considered "civilian activity" and which in no way could contribute to confrontation or to a violation of the military status quo.
UNFICYP is in the process of being restructured as the first step on the basis of the proposal by the Secretary-General in his report of 30 March 1993, 1/ paragraphs 16-19.
The restructured UNFICYP would continue to interpose itself between the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot forces and to supervise the cease-fire lines that define the buffer zone by observing and reporting any violations of the cease-fire and the status quo.
The cease-fire lines extend approximately 180 kilometres from Kokkina enclave and Kato Pyrgos on the north-west coast to the east coast south of Farmagusta in the area of Dherinia.
The total area between the cease-fire lines, the width of which varies from 20 metres to 7 kilometres, covers about 3 per cent of the island.
In addition, UNFICYP is required to maintain effective liaison with both sides at all levels.
In order for UNFICYP to achieve the tasks set for the mission and to be able to control the buffer zone, a minimum strength of at least six companies on the cease-fire line is required.
The current authorized troop strength of the Force is 1,323 and consists of infantry personnel (1,050), support personnel (223), including 37 military personnel forming the headquarters unit, civilian police (38) and military observers (12).
The civilian police are provided by Australia and Sweden and are based in five stations across the island.
Their main functions are:
To investigate criminal or other matters having inter-communal connotations or the possibility of political escalation;
To provide support as required for the prevention of civil disorder within the buffer zone;
To maintain liaison with civilian police from both communities;
To support directly the humanitarian activities of UNFICYP in two main sectors.
The military observers are provided by Austria, Ireland and Hungary.
The main function of the observers is for liaison and reconnaissance.
As decided by the Security Council in its resolution 831 (1993), a comprehensive reassessment of UNFICYP will be carried out with a view to further restructuring, at the time of the consideration of the Force's mandate in December 1993.
That reassessment will include an evaluation of progress made in the area of confidence-building towards a political settlement.
III. COST ESTIMATE FOR THE PERIOD FROM 16 JUNE TO 15 DECEMBER 1993
It is estimated that the cost of maintaining UNFICYP for the current mandate period of six months from 16 June to 15 December 1993 is $21,512,000 gross ($21,153,300 net).
Annex I to the present report sets out by budget line item a summary of the estimated costs, and supplementary information thereon is presented in annex II.
FORCE IN CYPRUS
In paragraph 6 of its resolution 186 (1964), the Security Council recommended that the costs of UNFICYP should be met by the Governments providing contingents, by the Government of Cyprus in accordance with article 19 of the Status of the Force Agreement, 2/ and by voluntary contributions to UNFICYP.
Appeals for voluntary contributions for the financing of UNFICYP, addressed to all Member States of the United Nations and to members of the specialized agencies, were issued by the Secretary-General twice a year.
However, the receipts from the appeals for voluntary contributions have never been sufficient to meet the United Nations share of the cost of UNFICYP based on the financial arrangements agreed between the United Nations and the troop-contributing Governments.
As early as August 1964, in paragraph 7 of his report to the Security Council on the financial situation of UNFICYP, 3/ the Secretary-General noted, inter alia, that there was a gap of over $2 million between the estimated costs for UNFICYP for the period through 26 September 1964 and the amount of cash pledged for its support.
The Secretary-General considered it essential that action should be taken immediately to obtain the additional financial support required for the continuing maintenance of the Force.
In his report to the Security Council dated 7 June 1977, 4/ the Secretary-General stated that by 7 June 1977, the deficit had increased to $51.4 million and as a result, payments to troop-contributing Governments in respect of their extra and extraordinary costs for which they sought reimbursement by the United Nations had begun to lag behind.
It therefore became necessary for the Secretary-General to undertake a special effort to try to improve the financial situation of UNFICYP by making certain high-level approaches to a number of Governments which had not yet contributed to the UNFICYP account or which might give consideration to an increase in their contributions.
This financial situation continued to deteriorate and in paragraph 65 of his report to the Security Council dated 2 December 1986, 5/ the Secretary-General indicated that he believed that unless there was a more generous response to his appeals for voluntary contributions than had been the case in recent years, the Council might wish to consider whether it would be appropriate to change the system of financing so that the costs to the United Nations would, in the future, be financed by means of assessed contributions.
The Security Council, by its resolution 682 (1990) of 21 December 1990, decided to examine the problem of the costs and financing of UNFICYP in all its aspects, bearing in mind the financial crisis facing the Force and the report of the Secretariat Review Team of 7 December 1990. 6/
The report of the Secretariat Review Team had made proposals for further reducing the costs of UNFICYP, but had also indicated that these proposals would only be possible if accompanied by a move to assessed contributions.
In its resolution 682 (1990), the Council also decided to report, by 1 June 1991, on alternative arrangements for meeting the costs of the Force for which the United Nations was responsible.
Between April and June 1991, there was a series of informal meetings of the members of the Group of Friends of the President of the Security Council to consider the implications of Security Council resolution 682 (1990).
The group concluded that those countries that had not yet accepted the case for assessed contributions would need to be persuaded that the costs of UNFICYP would be kept to a minimum.
In paragraph 3 of its resolution 698 (1991) of 14 June 1991, the Council requested the Secretary-General to hold consultations with members of the Council, troop-contributing countries and others concerned, on the question of costs, taking into account both the report of the United Nations Secretariat Review Team of 7 December 1990 and the report of the Group of Friends of the President of the Security Council of 31 May 1991.
The Security Council further requested the Secretary-General to report to the Council by 1 October 1991 and undertook to decide on measures to be taken to put the Force onto a sound and secure financial basis.
However, on 12 December 1991, following the extension of UNFICYP for a further six-month period ending 15 June 1992, the President of the Security Council, on behalf of the members of the Council, indicated that in light of the discussion at the informal consultations of members of the Security Council, it had been concluded that the necessary agreement did not exist in the Council for a decision to change the financing of UNFICYP.
The members of the Council did agree to keep the issue under review.
The Secretary-General, in a report to the Security Council dated 1 December 1992, 8/ indicated that he was pursuing consultations with troop-contributing Governments about a restructuring of the Force.
Subsequently, in a further report 1/ on 30 March 1993, the Secretary-General indicated that the size of UNFICYP had been significantly reduced owing to the withdrawal of 323 personnel from the Danish battalion, 198 personnel from the United Kingdom contingent, 63 personnel from the Austrian contingent and 61 personnel from the Canadian contingent.
This resulted in a reduction in the combined military personnel and civilian police strength from 2,141 in May 1992 to 1,513 in March 1993.
It was also indicated that the remaining 445 Canadian personnel would withdraw in June 1993.
On 27 May 1993, the Security Council adopted its resolution 831 (1993) in which, inter alia, it decided that the costs of UNFICYP which were not covered by voluntary contributions should be treated as expenses of the Organization, effective from the extension of the mandate on 15 June 1993.
V. FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION
From the inception of the Force, the Secretary-General established an account outside the regular budget, covering all financial transactions pertaining to UNFICYP.
The UNFICYP account is kept on a calendar-year basis; the financial statements are produced and audited on a biennial basis in accordance with United Nations financial regulations 11.1 and 11.4.
The Regulations for UNFICYP issued on 25 April 1964 (ST/SGB/UNFICYP/1) indicated, under paragraph 19, that "Financial administration of the Force shall be limited to the voluntary contributions in cash or in-kind made available to the United Nations and shall be in accordance with the Financial Rules and Regulations of the United Nations and the procedures prescribed by the Secretary-General".
Consequently, the Secretary-General has no authority to provide United Nations funds to meet costs pertaining to UNFICYP other than through voluntary contributions received for the purpose.
The Security Council, prior to its decision to extend the mandate of UNFICYP, is informed by the Secretary-General of the cost estimate for maintaining the Force during the extension period, including the operational expenses to be borne by the Organization as well as the amounts required to reimburse the troop-contributing Governments for the extra and extraordinary expenses which they would seek to be reimbursed by the United Nations.
Allotments are issued within the limits of the overall funds available to UNFICYP.
In the issuance of such allotments, the current operational requirements, and those of the immediate future if an extension of the mandate is approaching, take precedence over reimbursement commitments to troop-contributing Governments.
Allotments for any one mandate period, therefore, may be greater than the contributions received for the same period, provided the total amount of funds available to UNFICYP for that and all other mandate periods is not exceeded.
Reimbursement commitments are reflected in the account only to the extent of available funds with the outstanding balance indicated by a footnote to the account.
As regards the period beginning 16 June 1993, the Secretary-General recommends the establishment of a special account for UNFICYP, under the authority of regulation 6.6 of the Financial Regulations of the United Nations, for the purpose of accounting for income received and expenditure incurred in respect of the Mission.
VI. VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS
As indicated in section IV above, prior to 16 June 1993 the financing of the administrative and logistic costs of the Force, as well as certain extra and extraordinary costs incurred by troop-contributing Governments, which were borne by the Organization, were dependent entirely on voluntary contributions from Governments.
Under those arrangements, the troop-contributing Governments made available to the United Nations troops whose regular pay and allowances and normal matériel expenses they agreed to pay themselves.
In addition, in accordance with article 19 of the Status of the Force Agreement, 2/ the Government of Cyprus provides, without cost to the Force and in agreement with the Force Commander, areas for headquarters, camps, and other premises as may be necessary for the accommodation and the fulfilment of the functions of UNFICYP.
As stated earlier, the voluntary contributions received have never been adequate to meet the costs to the United Nations of UNFICYP.
In this regard, the Secretary-General, in his latest letter dated 25 March 1993, 9/ containing an appeal for voluntary contributions to all States Members of the United Nations or members of the specialized agencies for the financing of UNFICYP pointed out that receipts continued to fall far short of the Organization's share of expenditures and expressed deep concern about the precarious financial situation of UNFICYP.
For the period since the inception of the Force until 15 June 1993, 79 countries, including a number of the troop-contributing Member States (see annex VII), have provided voluntary financial support to UNFICYP totalling some $490.2 million in cash contributions ($474.5 million) and pledges ($15.7 million).
However, owing to consistent shortfalls during the period to meet the costs for which the Organization is responsible, the UNFICYP account is in arrears by over $200 million.
As regards the period beginning 16 June 1993, two pledges of contributions have been received for UNFICYP.
A second pledge was received from the Government of Greece, by letter dated 7 May 1993, which informed the Secretary-General of the decision of the Government of Greece to increase its annual voluntary contribution to UNFICYP to $6.5 million, should the financing system of UNFICYP be converted to assessed contributions.
Therefore, a total of $25 million is expected from voluntary contributions towards the estimated annual cost of UNFICYP for the period beginning 16 June 1993.
VII. STATUS OF REIMBURSEMENT TO TROOP-CONTRIBUTING STATES
Under existing agreements made prior to 15 June 1993, UNFICYP troop-contributors volunteered to absorb the regular costs that would be incurred by them if their contingents were serving at home (i.e., regular allowances and normal expenses for matériel).
However, as mentioned in paragraph 30 above, the cost to the United Nations for maintaining UNFICYP included amounts to reimburse the troop-contributing Governments for certain of the expenses they incurred for providing troops to the Force.
These claims were referred to as extra and extraordinary costs, for which they sought reimbursement by the United Nations.
Owing to the lack of sufficient voluntary contributions to UNFICYP, the latest reimbursement to the troop-contributing Governments for extra and extraordinary costs was made in June 1992 and covered claims for the six-month period ending December 1981.
As indicated in the Secretary-General's report of 9 June 1993 11/ to the Security Council, an estimated amount of over $200 million remains outstanding, based on actual and estimated claims for the period from January 1982 through June 1993.
The composition of the claims for extra and extraordinary costs differed among the troop-contributing Governments and included a variety of costs for such items as overseas/special/expatriation/hardship allowances, transportation within the home country to and from embarkation points, medical examinations, inoculations, travel documents, personal clothing and equipment, special issues of battalion equipment furnished at the request of the United Nations and other stores and expendable supplies not provided by the United Nations.
Beginning 16 June 1993, the cost estimates provide for standard troop-costs reimbursement, based on the rates established by the General Assembly in its resolution 45/258 of 3 May 1991.
No reimbursement to the troop-contributors has been made for this period.
UNITED NATIONS PEACE-KEEPING FORCE IN CYPRUS
In order to provide UNFICYP with the necessary funding for its maintenance for the period beginning 16 June 1993, the Secretary-General, in a letter dated 23 June 1993, sought the concurrence of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions to enter into commitments in an amount not to exceed $6.9 million for the period from 16 June to 30 September 1993, pending the submission of a detailed report on the financing of UNFICYP to the General Assembly.
The Advisory Committee, in responding to the request, noted that voluntary contributions pledged and which were expected to be paid shortly, exceeded the commitment authority sought.
The Committee also noted, inter alia, that as the General Assembly had not considered the issue, the Committee should not act on this matter.
To enable UNFICYP to meet its operational requirements, and pending the submission of the present report to the General Assembly, spending authority in an amount not to exceed $2 million was authorized by the Controller under the provisions of United Nations financial rule 110.6. On 4 August 1993, payment of the pledged contribution by the Government of Cyprus in an amount of $18 million was received.
A payment of $500,000 had been received previously for the current mandate period.
As stated in the Secretary-General's report of 9 June 1993, 11/ prior to 15 June 1993 UNFICYP was funded entirely from voluntary contributions from Governments.
Presently, there is an accumulated deficit of over $200 million due to the troop-contributing countries.
This amount represents outstanding reimbursements of UNFICYP to the troop-contributing countries under the financing scheme heretofore in place.
Consequently, the General Assembly may wish to consider necessary arrangements for financing the outstanding amount to UNFICYP troop contributors and to make the required provisions therefor.
AT ITS FORTY-SEVENTH SESSION
The action that would appear to be required in connection with the financing of UNFICYP would be an appropriation of the amount of $9,012,000 gross ($8,653,300 net) and the apportionment thereof, after taking into consideration voluntary contributions of $12,500,000, for the period from 16 June to 15 December 1993.

FINANCING OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE PROSECUTION OF
PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL
HUMANITARIAN LAW COMMITTED IN THE TERRITORY OF THE FORMER
YUGOSLAVIA SINCE 1991
Note by the Secretariat
1. By its resolution 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, the Security Council, having considered the report of the Secretary-General prepared pursuant to paragraph 2 of Council resolution 808 (1993) of 22 February 1993 (S/25704 and Corr.1 and Add.1) and acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, approved that report and decided to establish an international tribunal for the sole purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia between 1 January 1991 and a date to be determined by the Security Council upon the restoration of peace and to that end to adopt the Statute of the International Tribunal annexed to the above-mentioned report.
2. Also by its resolution 827 (1993), the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to implement urgently the resolution and in particular to make practical arrangements for the effective functioning of the International Tribunal at the earliest time and to report periodically to the Council.
The Council also decided to remain actively seized of the matter.
3. On the basis of a request of the Secretary-General (see A/47/955), the General Assembly at its 104th plenary meeting on 28 May 1993 decided to include in the agenda of its forty-seventh session an item entitled "Financing of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991" and to allocate it to the Fifth Committee.
4. In its report of 22 July 1993 (A/47/980), the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions brought to the attention of the General Assembly the fact that it had considered a request from the Secretary-General on the financing of the International Tribunal.
93-45986 (E) 230893 /... English Page be borne by the regular budget of the United Nations in accordance with Article 17 of the Charter of the United Nations".
The Committee also noted that the General Assembly had not yet taken a decision on the nature of financing of the International Tribunal, and had therefore requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on the requirements of the Tribunal to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session, based on such decisions as the Assembly might take at its resumed forty-seventh session on the nature of the financing of the Tribunal.
5. In the light of the above, the General Assembly may wish to take a decision on the nature of the financing of the International Tribunal during its forty-seventh session.
6. Article 32 of the Statute of the International Tribunal, entitled "Expenses of the International Tribunal" (quoted in para. 4 above), was included in the report of the Secretary-General prepared pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 (1993) (S/25704 and Corr.1).
By that resolution, the Secretary-General had been requested to submit a report on all aspects of this matter, including specific proposals and where appropriate, options for the effective and expeditious implementation of the decision to establish an international tribunal, taking into account suggestions put forward in this regard by Member States.
7. The Secretary-General had decided to include in his report a reference to the financial arrangements for the International Tribunal, in the light of the Council's request that he submit a report "on all aspects" of the matter, including specific proposals "for the effective and expeditious implementation" of the decision to establish an international tribunal.
It had been quite explicitly indicated in the relevant Council consultations that the report was expected to cover the question of financial arrangements, and to omit from the report references to that important aspect of the matter would not have been in compliance with the Council's request.
Moreover, leaving the matter open would not have facilitated the effective and expeditious implementation of the decision to establish an international tribunal.
The Secretary-General had thus concluded that as the proposed Statute of the International Tribunal would be comprehensive and intended for effective and expeditious implementation, it would contain a specific provision on the expenses of the International Tribunal.
That conclusion was reached without prejudice to the role of the General Assembly in the administrative and budgetary aspects of the question of establishing the International Tribunal, to which reference was made in the report (S/25704, para. 21).
8. As to the content of such a provision, the Secretary-General had considered various possible ways by which the International Tribunal could be financed: through voluntary contributions; as expenses of the Organization borne according to an ad hoc scale of assessments similar to scales of assessments drawn up for peace-keeping operations; as expenses of the Organization borne through the regular budget of the United Nations; or through any combination of the foregoing.
9. As experience shows, funding the International Tribunal through voluntary contributions, wholly or in part, would not, in the view of the Secretary-General, lead to an effective and expeditious implementation of the decision to establish an international tribunal.
10. While the International Tribunal was established by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII as a measure to maintain and restore international peace and security, the Tribunal was not thereby to be equated to a peace-keeping operation.
The International Tribunal is a subsidiary organ of the Security Council of a judicial nature, having as its mandate the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991.
Its mandate is not analogous to mandates given by the Security Council to peace-keeping operations which have particular political objectives and which often include military, police or security components.
11. In the light of the above, the Secretary-General decided to propose an article for inclusion in the Statute providing that the expenses of the International Tribunal shall be borne by the regular budget of the Organization.
12. The Security Council approved the approach of the Secretary-General outlined above and included the proposed article in the Statute adopted.
In the view of the Secretary-General, within the context of preparing a comprehensive Statute of the International Tribunal to be implemented effectively and expeditiously, there was no legal bar to the Security Council reaching its own conclusions as to the appropriate financing of the International Tribunal and including a provision on the matter in the Statute which it adopted.
Nevertheless, such conclusions are without prejudice to the authority of the General Assembly under the Charter to consider and approve the budget of the Organization and to apportion the expenses of the Organization among its Members.

Agenda item 157
FINANCING OF THE UNITED NATIONS PEACE-KEEPING FORCE IN CYPRUS
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General (A/47/1001) on the financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
The Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General who provided additional information.
2. The Committee's consideration of the Secretary-General's report was on the basis of an advance text in English; members of the Committee have agreed to such a procedure with increasing frequency, especially with regard to peace-keeping operations, in an effort to respond to urgent situations and also to conform to the schedule of the Fifth Committee.
Aside from the burden this places on members who legitimately would prefer to work in one of the other official languages of the United Nations, the Committee points out that the Secretary-General's reports are frequently corrected or otherwise changed before circulation in final form; this makes it more difficult for the Committee to ensure the accuracy of its own reports.
The Committee trusts that the Secretary-General will redouble his efforts to ensure timely submission of final documentation, in all languages, to the Committee.
3. By its resolution 186 (1964) of 4 March 1964, the Security Council recommended that the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus be established and be stationed in Cyprus for a period of three months, with a mandate to use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of fighting and, as necessary, to contribute to the maintenance and restoration of law and order and a return to normal conditions.
The costs of UNFICYP were to be met by the Governments providing the contingents and by the Government of Cyprus; the Secretary-General has also accepted voluntary contributions for UNFICYP.
In paragraph 41 of his report, the Secretary-General refers to amounts which have not been reimbursed to certain troop contributors in respect of past mandate periods.
4. UNFICYP became operational on 27 March 1964.
Since then the Security Council has extended the duration of the mandate of UNFICYP mainly for six-month periods, most recently by resolution 839 (1993) of 11 June 1993, by which the mandate was extended from 16 June to 15 December 1993.
5. For the period beginning on 16 June 1993, the Secretary-General has proposed that the costs of UNFICYP which are not covered by voluntary contributions should be assessed on Member States from that date and that a new special account should be established.
6. As indicated in paragraph 33 of the report, the Government of Cyprus, by a letter dated 15 April 1993 to the Secretary-General, conveyed its offer to contribute, on a continuing basis, that is, for the period beginning on 16 June 1993 and future periods, a voluntary contribution equal to one third of the annual cost of UNFICYP.
In a subsequent letter dated 10 May 1993, the Government of Cyprus confirmed that its voluntary contribution for the 12-month period beginning on 16 June 1993 would be increased to $18.5 million.
7. By a letter dated 7 May 1993, the Government of Greece informed the Secretary-General of its decision to increase its annual voluntary contribution to UNFICYP to $6.5 million, provided that there is a decision to base the financing of UNFICYP on assessed contributions and that the structure and the strength of the Force, that is, at least six companies, remain unchanged.
8. The Secretary-General estimates that the cost of maintaining UNFICYP for the current mandate period of six months from 16 June to 15 December 1993 is $21,512,000 gross ($21,153,300 net).
Taking into account voluntary contributions of $12,500,000, the Secretary-General is proposing an appropriation of the amount of $9,012,000 gross ($8,653,300 net) and the apportionment thereof, for the period from 16 June to 15 December 1993.
9. The Committee points out that it is for the General Assembly to decide on how the expenditures of UNFICYP are to be financed.
It therefore submits its comments and recommendations in the paragraphs below without prejudice to any decision the General Assembly may take on the question of financing.
10. The Committee notes that, in its resolution 831 (1993) of 27 May 1993, the Security Council decided to conduct a comprehensive reassessment of UNFICYP at the time of the consideration of the Force's mandate in December 1993.
The Committee requests the Secretary-General, following that reassessment, to report to the General Assembly on the administrative and financial aspects of such decisions as the Security Council may take.
11. The Security Council, in its resolution 831 (1993), decided that UNFICYP should be restructured, as a first step, on the basis of the proposal set out in paragraphs 16 to 19 of the Secretary-General's report of 30 March 1993 (S/25492), that is, at a strength of three infantry battalions of approximately 350 personnel each, with the addition of a limited number of military observers.
12. The operational plan for UNFICYP called for by the Security Council in its resolution 831 (1993) is outlined in paragraphs 5 to 11 of the report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly (A/47/1001).
As stated in paragraph 9 of the report, the current authorized troop strength of the Force is 1,323, consisting of infantry personnel (1,050), support personnel, including 37 military personnel forming the headquarters unit (223), civilian police (38) and military observers (12). English
Page 13. For operational purposes, UNFICYP will be divided into three sectors covered by three battalions.
The Committee was informed that at the present time only two battalions were physically available to UNFICYP and that a third battalion was tentatively scheduled to arrive in early September 1993.
The Committee points out that, should that schedule not be met, there will be savings for the period for each day of delay after 1 September 1993.
14. The Committee understands that certain of the standard rates used in the calculations in the budget estimates have been adjusted as the result of the Secretary-General's proposal on the financing of UNFICYP.
The Committee requests the Secretary-General to review those rates and to justify fully any change from the standard rates used prior to 16 June 1993, in the report requested in paragraph 10 above.
15. In the opinion of the Committee, the role and functions of the military observers being introduced in UNFICYP are still to be defined.
The Committee expects that that will be done on the basis of experience gained during the current mandate and explained in the context of the forthcoming report of the Secretary-General (see para. 10 above).
16. The Committee notes from annex II, table I, of the report that, at this stage, the Secretary-General is proposing an increase of 21 posts in the current civilian staffing component of UNFICYP of 452 posts.
Of the 21 additional proposed posts, 8 are in the Field Service category and 13 are local staff.
In this connection, the Committee was informed that the existing 414 and the proposed additional 13 local personnel are, and would continue to be, obtained through contractual services from the United Kingdom Command Secretariat, and as such they are not United Nations personnel.
17. The Committee requests the Secretary-General to review, in the context of his forthcoming report (see para. 10 above), the level of staffing provided for under that contractual arrangement and to ascertain whether the services required by the Force warrant such a level of personnel.
Pending such a review the Committee does not recommend approval of the additional 13 posts.
For similar reasons the Committee does not recommend approval of the eight additional posts in the Field Service category at this stage.
The total resultant savings for six months would be $241,500 gross ($210,200 net).
18. Having considered the job descriptions relating to international staff set out in annex VIII to the report and the additional information provided by the representatives of the Secretary-General, the Committee is not convinced that the functions of the existing spokesman (P-5) post cannot be combined with those of the existing Senior Adviser (D-1) post.
In this connection the Committee also believes that some of the non-technical functions of the Field Service posts listed in annex VIII could either be combined or performed by locally recruited personnel.
19. The Committee notes that provision is made for 50 consultancy days at $568 per day, together with subsistence allowance at $204 per day for 50 days for the non-resident Special Representative of the Secretary-General.
In addition, there is a Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General who is at the Assistant Secretary-General level and resident in Cyprus.
The Committee believes that this arrangement requires additional clarification and justification, especially as concerns the consultant status of the Special Representative (see para. 10 above).
20. The Committee notes that in recent months the Secretary-General has appointed a number of representatives and envoys and in this connection reiterates its view (see A/47/990) that there is a need for a clear statement of the rationale for the establishment of posts at the Assistant Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General levels.
Furthermore the Committee believes that not only should there be a policy for the establishment of such high-level posts but that criteria for determining the related emoluments should also be established.
21. The Committee was informed that when the Secretary-General's cost estimates for UNFICYP were being prepared it was not known how much equipment, with the exception of some communications equipment, could be obtained from the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC).
In this connection, the Committee requests the Secretary-General to review the situation vis-à-vis the disposition of UNTAC assets and to report to it in the context of the report requested in paragraph 10 above.
22. With regard to transport operation costs, as reflected in paragraph 31 of annex II, provision has been made in the estimates for the acquisition of 16 vehicles at a cost of $126,600.
The Committee was informed that those vehicles were obtained at favourable rates from the departing Canadian contingent.
The proposed distribution of vehicles is set out in annex V. From the information provided to it, the Committee believes that the number of vehicles proposed should be revised.
23. The Committee was informed that humanitarian activities in the area were not on the scale or of the nature of the humanitarian activities associated with other recent peace-keeping operations.
In UNFICYP those activities have traditionally included facilitating family reunion visits between the two communities in Cyprus, the delivery of medicines and pension cheques to enclosed communities, supervision of medical evacuations, and facilitating communications between authorities of public utilities.
The Committee was informed that while those activities require relatively few UNFICYP personnel, they have a vital impact in improvement of intercommunal relations.
24. In view of the general observations and recommendations set out above, particularly in paragraph 17, the Committee believes that the cost for the maintenance of UNFICYP for the period from 16 June to 15 December 1993 should not exceed $21,271,000 gross ($20,943,000 net).
Should the General Assembly decide that the costs of UNFICYP which are not covered by voluntary contributions should be assessed on Member States, the resulting appropriation should not exceed $8,771,000 gross ($8,443,000 net).

I. INTRODUCTION
1. By its resolution 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, the Security Council approved the report of the Secretary-General prepared pursuant to paragraph 2 of Council resolution 808 (1993) of 22 February 1993 (S/25704 and Corr.1 and Add.1), and decided to establish an international tribunal for the sole purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia between 1 January 1991 and a date to be determined by the Security Council upon the restoration of peace, and to that end to adopt the Statute of the International Tribunal annexed to the Secretary-General's report.
2. At its 104th plenary meeting, on 28 May 1993, the General Assembly decided, on the proposal of the Secretary-General (A/47/955, para. 1), to include in the agenda of its forty-seventh session an item entitled "Election of judges of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991" (item 156).
3. Pursuant to article 13, subparagraph 2 (a), of the Statute of the International Tribunal, the Legal Counsel, on behalf of the Secretary-General, invited, by circular letter of 3 June 1993, all States Members of the United Nations and non-member States maintaining permanent observer missions at United Nations Headquarters to submit their nominations for judges of the International Tribunal.
In accordance with article 13, subparagraph 2 (b), of the Statute, each State was invited to nominate, within 60 days of the date of the invitation, up to two candidates, no two of whom were to be of the same nationality.
4. The nominations received were forwarded by the Secretary-General to the President of the Security Council in accordance with article 13, subparagraph 2 (c), of the Statute of the International Tribunal.
At its 3265th meeting, on 20 August 1993, the Security Council, in accordance with that article, established a list of 23 candidates, taking due account of the adequate representation of the principal legal systems of the world.
The list was adopted in resolution 857 (1993), and was formally conveyed to the President of the General Assembly by letter dated 20 August 1993 from the President of the Security Council (A/47/1003).
5. The list of candidates for judges and the procedure for the election of the judges of the International Tribunal are set out below.
The curricula vitae of the candidates will be transmitted to the General Assembly in a separate document (A/47/1006).
II. LIST OF CANDIDATES FOR JUDGES OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL
6. The list of candidates for judges of the International Tribunal is as follows:*
Mr. Georges Michel ABI-SAAB (Egypt)
Mr. Julio A. BARBERIS (Argentina)
Mr. Raphaël BARRAS (Switzerland)
Mr. Sikhe CAMARA (Guinea)
Mr. Antonio CASSESE (Italy)
Mr. Alfonso DE LOS HEROS (Peru)
Mr. Jules DESCHENES (Canada)
Mr. Jerzy JASINSKI (Poland)
Mr. Heike JUNG (Germany)
Mr. Adolphus Godwin KARIBI-WHYTE (Nigeria)

Mr. Hüseyin PAZARCI (Turkey)
Mr. Moragodage Christopher Walter PINTO (Sri Lanka)
Mr. Rustam S. SIDHWA (Pakistan)
Sir Ninian STEPHEN (Australia)
Mr. Lal Chan VOHRAH (Malaysia)
III. PROCEDURE FOR THE ELECTION OF JUDGES
7. The election of judges will take place in accordance with the following provisions:
(a) Article 13 of the Statute of the International Tribunal;
(b) Given the similar nature of the election of judges of the International Court of Justice and the election of judges of the International Tribunal, the Secretary-General suggests that similar election procedures should be followed in the General Assembly.
For this reason, it is suggested that rule 151 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly shall apply to the election of judges of the International Tribunal.
8. In accordance with article 13, subparagraph 2 (a), of the Statute of the International Tribunal, the Holy See and Switzerland, the two non-member States maintaining permanent observer missions at United Nations Headquarters which were invited to nominate judges for the International Tribunal, will participate in the election in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations.
9. On the date of the election, the General Assembly shall elect 11 judges from the list of candidates submitted to it by the Security Council.
Only those candidates whose names appear on the ballot papers are eligible for election.
The electors will indicate the candidates for whom they wish to vote by placing crosses against their names on the ballot papers.
10. The candidates who receive an absolute majority of the votes of States Members of the United Nations and of the non-member States maintaining permanent observer missions at United Nations Headquarters shall be declared elected (art. 13, subpara. 2 (d), of the Statute).
11. The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they vote.
The electors, for this purpose, are all the Member States and the two non-member States mentioned in paragraph 8 above.
Accordingly, 94 votes constitute an absolute majority in the General Assembly for the purpose of electing judges of the International Tribunal.
12. If fewer than the required number of candidates obtain the absolute majority in the first ballot, a second ballot will be held and balloting will continue at the same meeting until the required number of candidates obtain an absolute majority.
Following the practice in the election of judges of the International Court of Justice, the Secretary-General suggests that subsequent balloting shall be unrestricted.
Accordingly, each elector may vote for 11 candidates in the first ballot and, in any subsequent ballots, for 11 less the number of candidates who have already obtained absolute majorities.
13. If more than the required number of candidates obtain the absolute majority of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will be held on all candidates and balloting will continue at the same meeting until the required number of candidates, and no more, obtain an absolute majority.
In any such case, each elector may vote, in the first ballot and in any subsequent ballot, for 11 candidates.
14. When 11 candidates obtain the required majority, the President of the General Assembly shall declare the candidates elected.

As external examiner I act as "watchdog" for the appointing universities over academic standards by approving examination papers before the examinations are given, going over student scripts after they have been marked by the internal examiner, and by making suggestions for the improvement of the academic programmes that I externalize.

Some of the cases resulted in precedent-setting decisions.

In response to the baseless allegations contained in the above-mentioned letter, I cannot do better than bring to your kind attention the relevant part of a statement issued by His Excellency Dr. Kenan Atakol, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence, on 24 August 1993, a copy of which is annexed hereto (see appendix).

on 24 August 1993
For years, the Greek Cypriot administration has been claiming that the Turkish Cypriot side is trying to change the demographic structure of Cyprus and, by using false figures which defy even the elementary norms of logic, has been attempting to deceive world public opinion.
A new example of this is the allegation that 5,000 Turkish nationals have recently been given Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus citizenship.
To claim that it is even possible to grant citizenship to so many people within the short time that has elapsed since the amendment of the old and outdated citizenship law, the Greek Cypriot authorities must be living in a dream world and must be running out of propaganda material.

ANNEX
Declaration of 27 August 1993 on the Situation in Nicaragua
Considering that peace in Central America is one, undivided and indivisible, and that, therefore, any development which disrupts peace has repercussions throughout the region and, in observance of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States, calls for prompt action by the Presidents with a view to helping to maintain political stability, the constitutional State and democratic institutions in Central America,
Accordingly, in order to promote the strengthening of the conditions that will enable the democratic process in Nicaragua to be consolidated, we, the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama, meeting with the President of Nicaragua in the City of San Salvador, El Salvador, have decided:
(1) To state our strongest condemnation of any act of violence and terrorism which threatens the life and personal safety of Nicaraguans or the security of the State and the stability of the lawfully constituted Government;
(2) To express our solidarity with and resolute support for the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua and its President, Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, in their endeavour to find workable solutions to the problems of the country, reaffirming our belief that the fullest respect for laws and democratic institutions is essential;
(3) To appeal to the various sectors of national life in Nicaragua to assume their share of responsibility in building the future of that fraternal country, urging them to reach a national agreement that will help to consolidate the political, economic and social stability which the fraternal nation seeks.
We therefore support the early implementation of the Agreement which was concluded on 21 August 1993 between the Government of Nicaragua, the Unión Nacional Opositora and the Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional for the purpose of removing all the obstacles that thus far have impeded institutional, economic and social normalization and the search for the general welfare of Nicaragua;
(4) At the request of the President of Nicaragua, and pursuant to articles 3, 15 and 17 of the Tegucigalpa Protocol, which are aimed at achieving the objective of the Central American Integration System of transforming Central America into a "region of peace, freedom, democracy and development", to instruct the Ministers for Foreign Affairs to use their good offices to bring about national agreement in Nicaragua;
(5) To appeal to the international community to continue to provide Nicaragua with the necessary cooperation to strengthen peace and reconciliation in the Nicaraguan family, this being a prerequisite for promoting the climate of political and social stability that will enable the nation to develop fully, ensuring the well-being of its people.

Statement on Haiti issued by the European Community and its
member States on 1 September 1993
The European Community and its member States welcome the ratification of Mr. Malval as Prime Minister by the Haitian parliament and his investiture by President Aristede.
This investiture constitutes a fundamental stage in the implementation of the New York agreement of 3 July 1993.
Following the suspension of sanctions on 27 August 1993 by the Security Council, the European Community and its member States are suspending the measures which they had introduced pursuant to Council resolution 841 (1993) of 16 June.
In accordance with their statement of 6 July, they will be resuming their cooperation with Haiti, which was interrupted by the coup d'état.
The European Community and its member States sincerely hope that the taking up of his duties by the Prime Minister will be followed by the implementation of the other points in the agreement of 3 July 1993 in order to conclude swiftly the process of restoring constitutional order and make possible the return of President Aristide to Haiti.

ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND ORGANIZATION OF WORK
REPORT OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE WORLD SOCIAL
Letter dated 2 September 1993 from the President of the
Economic and Social Council to the President of the
General Assembly
The Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1993/23 of 27 July 1993, which was adopted on the recommendation of the Commission for Social Development, approved the attached draft resolution entitled "International Year of the Family", for transmission to the General Assembly for its adoption.
The draft resolution contains several provisions which call for immediate action, including some during the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, in prior consultation with Member States.
One such recommendation is contained in paragraph 14, in which the Assembly would decide "to devote one of its plenary meetings at its forty-eighth session, in early December 1993, to launching the International Year of the Family"; another is contained in paragraph 20, requesting the Secretary-General "to seek the views of Member States of the Commission for Social Development on the desirability to work out a declaration on the role, responsibilities and rights of families on the occasion of the International Year of the Family".
Should the draft resolution, according to normal procedures, be submitted to the General Assembly for action at its forty-eighth session, it would not be acted upon until the Assembly considers the report of the Economic and Social Council during the latter part of its forty-eighth session.
This would leave very little time to take adequate preparatory steps for the Assembly's launching of the International Year of the Family in early December 1993.
Therefore, it is of special urgency that the Assembly give earlier consideration to the draft resolution than under its routine procedures.
93-48910 (E) 090993 /... Further to consultations with the Coordinator for the International Year of the Family, I wish to propose that, because of the exigencies of the situation, the draft resolution be acted upon by the General Assembly at one of its last meetings of the forty-seventh session, thereby greatly facilitating the preparatory process to the International Year of the Family.
I have been informed that, in August, the matter of an earlier action on the resolution had been presented to the chairman of the regional groups by the Coordinator for the Year during his visit to New York and that they had consented to brief their respective groups in detail on the matter.
I should be grateful to Your Excellency for your prompt consideration of tha matter and for your concurrence that we take up this resolution at the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly.

15. Also decides that, beginning in 1994, 15 May of every year shall be observed as the International Day of Families;
16. Requests the Commission on Human Rights, the Population Commission and the Commission on the Status of Women to include in the agendas for their sessions in 1993 or 1994 consideration of the principles and objectives of the Year in the context of their major areas of concern, and to propose specific follow-up measures regarding human rights, population issues and the advancement of women as each affects or is affected by families, including family-oriented components of the World Conference on Human Rights, to be held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993, the International Conference on Population and Development, to be held at Cairo from 5 to 13 September 1994, the World Summit for Social Development, to be held in Denmark in 1995, and the Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace, to be held at Beijing from 4 to 15 September 1995;

18. Appeals to Member States as well as to all other participants in the observance of the Year to highlight 1994 as a special event benefiting families of the world in their quest for a better life for all, based on the principle of subsidiarity, which seeks solutions to problems at the lowest level of the societal structure;

Note by the Secretary-General
The attached document contains the report of the Director of the Human Rights Division of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) up to 31 July 1993.
As will be recalled (see S/23999, para. 3), it was decided that the work of ONUSAL in relation to the San José Agreement on Human Rights (A/44/971-S/21541, annex) would be the subject of a separate series of reports.

ANNEX
Report of the Director of the Human Rights Division of the
United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador up to 31 July 1993
I. INTRODUCTION
1. This report contains an evaluation of the human rights situation in El Salvador during the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993.
The text follows the basic structure of previous reports, although it has been deemed appropriate to group the summary accounts of some representative cases of existing violations in a supplementary document.
2. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the work of active verification receives the necessary public dissemination, which in itself is a means of promotion and protection, beginning with this report it has been deemed appropriate to include an account of all complaints declared admissible by the Human Rights Division during the period under consideration.
3. The report contains, in addition, the results of a study examining the degree of effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the application of the remedy of amparo in judicial practice, the goal, as always, being to contribute to the judicial reform process and to help improve the administration of justice.
4. As stated in the previous report, the section on ONUSAL recommendations contains a detailed analysis of the compliance or non-compliance with those recommendations.
5. The methodology used in the reports takes as a point of reference the changes in the human rights situation over the three months analysed in each report.
Thus, the reports do not necessarily reflect trends, but rather, situations at different points in time.
Analysis of trends will be included in the ninth report on the basis of cumulative data over nine months.
II. OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION
6. The human rights situation in El Salvador continues to evolve in an ambivalent manner. On the one hand, signs of improvement are continuing while, on the other, grave violations, especially in relation to the right to life, persist and are even growing worse.
The fact that there have been no reports of enforced disappearances over a total period of 13 months illustrates the former; the existence of politically motivated arbitrary executions and torture, the latter.
7. In the context of the implementation of the peace agreements, this reality calls for greater responsibility on the part of the State in fulfilling its obligation to provide guarantees, especially with regard to ensuring that the perpetrators of violations do not go unpunished.
The fact that a large part of the complaints verified by ONUSAL, the Office of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights and non-governmental organizations continue to go unpunished, notwithstanding the institutional reforms undertaken, is due to the limited ability of the competent bodies to investigate offences and punish offenders. This situation brings with it negative consequences that can result in an increase in violations and can jeopardize existing improvements. English Page
8. At the same time the violence continues, and no overall solution has been found for dealing with the real causes of the problem.
There is a pressing need to disarm civilians who are in possession of military weapons, and this calls for the immediate approval of appropriate legislation so that the necessary administrative measures may be taken for the recovery of these weapons.
9. With regard to the situation of trade union rights and freedom of association, there are growing problems that require fundamental solutions both within the Forum for Economic and Social Consultation and with respect to the labour conflicts which have just arisen.
Dialogue and negotiation are indispensable tools of a labour policy compatible with the peace agreements and existing international norms.
The State, the business community and workers must continue on this path in search of negotiated agreements.
III. ANALYSIS OF ACTIVE VERIFICATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION
A. Right to life
10. Complaints declared admissible in the three months covered by this report indicate an increase in violations of the right to life, against the backdrop of a situation where such violations appear to be the most serious.
In the month of July alone, in the central region of the country, 14 complaints concerning death threats were received, 7 concerning arbitrary executions, 4 concerning attempted arbitrary executions and 1 concerning abduction.
Overall figures for the three months under consideration indicated that 92 complaints of violations of the right to life were received, of which 52 involved arbitrary executions or attempted arbitrary execution.
11. Quantitative indicators reveal only part of the problem.
A large percentage of the reported violations of the right to life have yet to be properly investigated, impeding the identification of the perpetrators.
As a consequence of both these facts, a high proportion of violations remain unpunished.
12. In this respect, the Human Rights Division must reiterate the comments offered in its sixth report that there is a persistent "absence of any policy governing the preservation of evidence relating to deaths or the taking of minimum care to preserve such evidence; the absence of any measures to ensure the safety of witnesses, and the improper handling of testimony; the failure to use the proper technical means to establish the cause, manner and time of death; the failure to perform autopsies in a significant number of cases, notwithstanding the commendable efforts of the Institute of Forensic Medicine; and the inefficiency of the judicial system and its auxiliary organs in identifying those responsible for deaths.
This inability to investigate crimes is reflected in the failure of judges to show any initiative in taking the requisite legal steps in the early stages of the investigation; in the slow and delayed participation of the Office of the Attorney-General; in the meagre or invalid evidence gathered for the purpose of establishing criminal liability; and in lenience in investigating cases involving military personnel or agents of the security forces, the direct result of which is impunity" (see A/47/912, p. 19).
1. Deaths resulting from the violation of juridical guarantees and arbitrary or extralegal executions
13. Cases of complaints of deaths resulting from the violation of juridical guarantees and arbitrary or extralegal executions increased by 30 per cent over the period February-April.
It is significant that in the months of June and July alone, 32 complaints were received.
These figures confirm the warnings by the Human Rights Division that the level of complaints of violations of the right to life was a cause for great concern.
14. Complaints of arbitrary executions increased from 7.45 per cent of the total in the February-April quarter to 10.1 per cent in this quarter.
As for who is responsible for violations of the right to life, the percentage of violations attributed to persons unknown increased to 34.7 per cent and that attributed to irregular groups increased to 25 per cent.
It is alarming to find that 59.7 per cent of the violations of the right to life are attributed to those two groups, indicating increasing activity by clandestine groups whose methods are similar to those of death squads.
15. Deaths of unidentified persons have continued to occur, and some of them show evidence of violence that goes beyond the intent to kill (Case No. SORU/382/93, Case No. ORSM/908/93 and Case No. ORSM/909/93).
Similar methods of killing were used in the cases of Carlos Aurelio Pérez Durán and Sául Ramón Marroquín Lovo (Case No. ORSS/2365/93) and Marina de la Paz Stanley Argueta (Case No. ORSS/2385/93).
16. Although it is certain that the verification of the cases mentioned in the preceding paragraph points to ordinary motives, the participation of former members of irregular groups which operated in the country during the 1980s cannot be definitively ruled out.
That could explain the apparent similarity between the modus operandi used in the aforementioned murders and that characteristic of the death squads of the time.
17. Active verification, on the other hand, has led to the corroboration of the allegations of arbitrary execution in the cases of Santos Martínez Pérez, Hector Manuel Contreras, José Buenaventura Vásquez, Angel Mendoza Villatoro and Hector David Segovia Verillas.
18. The case of Santos Martínez Pérez had national political repercussions, since he was killed by shots fired by members of the National Police riot squad during a demonstration of war-disabled persons on 20 May 1993.
After investigating the matter, the Fourth Criminal Court of San Salvador ordered the provisional detention of officer Alberto Ponce Zuñiga as the individual responsible for the crime of intentional homicide.
The Office of the Director of the National Police has not handed the officer over to the court, notwithstanding the detention order.
19. The other two cases where the work of active verification was focused concerned the murders of Monsignor Pedro Joaquín Ramos Umaña and Juan Francisco Grande which were linked to the logistical team of the Fuerzas Populares de Liberacion, an integral part of the FMLN party.
20. In the case of Monsignor Ramos Umaña, the President of the Republic ordered a swift investigation to discover the facts.
At the same time, the Archbishop of San Salvador decided to set up an investigative commission.
ONUSAL carried out the appropriate verification, and arrived at specific conclusions; these will be made public once the investigative commission set up by the Archbishopric completes its work, in order to avoid interfering with this investigation.
21. The murder of Juan Francisco García Grande was the subject of a prompt investigation by the National Police, in principle coinciding with the active verification conducted by ONUSAL.
A preliminary hypothesis has been established regarding the motive for the crime (personal dispute) and the alleged perpetrator has been identified.
However, in order to be able to state that this homicide had no political motivation, the investigation still under way must be completed, since the available evidence does not a priori rule out other possibilities, which are under investigation.
22. During the period under consideration, officers of the armed forces were also killed (Captain Juan Hernández Mejía, Lieutenant Armando Castillo Mejía, Lieutenant Antonio García Santillana), as well as members of the National Police (José Inés González and Mario Alfonso Mejía).
The self-styled Frente Revolucionario Salvadoreño initially claimed responsibility for the killings.
Subsequently, it was established that they were ordinary homicides.

SDO STATE'S DUTY TO PROVIDE GUARANTEES FULFILLED
2. Attempted arbitrary or extralegal executions
23. According to the statistics, nine complaints of attempted arbitrary execution have been declared admissible.
One of the complaints verified, that of Gregorio Mejía Espinoza, Secretary of a local organization, the Movimiento Popular Social Christiano, is particularly serious.
The verification revealed it to be a politically motivated case of attempted arbitrary execution. The victim was abducted and tortured, although the attempt itself was unsuccessful.
24. Such occurrences are incompatible with the rule of law and the democratic legal order.
Practices of this kind must be totally outlawed and punished in accordance with the law.
The State must comply with its duty to provide guarantees so as to ensure that this case does not go unpunished, an outcome which would seriously undermine efforts to maintain the democratic legal order.
3. Death threats
25. Death threats continue to occur in significant numbers.
During the period under review, 40 complaints were declared admissible, many of them relating to politically motivated threats designed to intimidate persons because of their ideas or party affiliation.
B. Right to integrity of person
1. Torture
27. In its sixth report, the Human Rights Division noted the encouraging fact that no cases of torture had been verified during the period under review (June 1992-January 1993).
In the seventh report, that situation remained fundamentally unchanged, although one case of police torture was recorded.
However, the verification undertaken in connection with the torture inflicted on Gregorio Mejía Alarcón has compelled the Human Rights Division to ask the Government to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that those responsible are punished, since politically motivated torture cannot go unpunished without undermining the State apparatus.
2. Ill-treatment
28. Complaints of ill-treatment have fallen by about one third by comparison with the previous period (42 complaints compared to 61 declared admissible for the period February to April).
This could be due to the efforts being undertaken in cooperation with the judicial system, the National Police and the National Civil Police to safeguard the rights of detainees.
In any case, time will tell whether this is a trend or merely a short-term situation.
C. Right to security of person
1. Enforced or involuntary disappearances
29. Once again, as in the two previous periods, no enforced disappearances were recorded.
This means that in an overall period of 13 months no disappearances have been verified, representing what appears to be a steady trend towards a marked improvement in the protection of the right to security of person.
2. Abductions
30. Abductions have remained at broadly the same level as the previous period (five).
ONUSAL is concerned that abductions are continuing to occur and that it continues to be impossible to punish those responsible.
Abduction as a violent common crime is also continuing to increase.
D. Right to liberty: arbitrary detentions
This situation is disturbing, bearing in mind that the methodology used by the Human Rights Division distinguishes between arbitrary detention as such and arbitrary detention for petty misdemeanours, a category whose specific characteristics make it less serious.
This increase could be a result of illegal excesses committed in an effort to combat crime.
32. In addition, the problems connected with petty misdemeanours continue to be the target of joint measures taken by ONUSAL and the competent authorities in an effort to reduce their incidence.
Various difficulties have been encountered in applying the police instructions which are designed to introduce specific rules to reduce the incidence of arbitrary detention for misdemeanours.
Measures are being agreed to overcome these practical problems.
ONUSAL repeats that the adoption of these legislative measures is of the utmost urgency.
E. Right to freedom of association and effective enjoyment
of trade union rights
33. Complaints concerning freedom of association have remained stable.
Looking beyond the statistics, a gradual increase can be seen in the number of unresolved conflicts involving trade unions.
No overall solutions suggesting a change of policy on the part of the authorities have yet been found to the problems posed by the recognition of the legal personality of trade unions and associations and the selective dismissal of trade union leaders.
In this connection, the cases of the Sindicato de Industrias Mecánicas y Metálicas and the Sindicato de Trabajadores de Empresas de Productos Agroindustriales are representative.
34. With regard to international agreements relating to the exercise of trade union rights, the Division has been informed that the Committee on Freedom of Association of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) will finally be received by Government authorities, thereby removing an obstacle to El Salvador's relations with ILO.
35. In general, trade union problems continue to be related mainly to the consideration of ILO conventions, the recognition of the legal personality of trade unions and associations, the settlement of labour conflicts and the definition of a new consensual legal framework; the latter should include agreements regarding the Act organizing the Ministry of Labour, the new Labour Code and the laws and regulations on social security.
36. The Forum for Economic and Social Consultation, which is responsible for reconciling the interests of the State, private industry and trade unions, has encountered difficulties in addressing these topics but has always sought constructive solutions.
There has been gradual progress towards ending the critical deadlock affecting the Forum's consideration of the ratification of ILO conventions and it is to be hoped that the parties will succeed in determining criteria that will make it possible to reconcile the different points of view.
37. The Human Rights Division encourages all sectors taking part in the Forum to find mutually satisfactory solutions in line with the obligations deriving from the peace agreements.
F. Right to due process of law
38. The number of complaints received in the months of May, June and July confirmed that most of the complaints received fall into the category of violation of the right to due process of law.
In the period under review, 102 complaints were declared admissible, a figure which nevertheless represents a slight decrease compared to the previous period.
The right most frequently violated is the legal duty of the State to investigate and punish offences.
40. Bearing in mind that the proposals for judicial reform promoted by the Ministry of Justice as a follow-up to the constitutional reforms adopted in 1991 are intended to contribute to the gradual establishment of a normative framework protective of human rights, emphasis should be placed on the adoption of the rules still pending and their practical application, which leads to the examination and assessment of judicial practice as such.
41. In the view of ONUSAL, priority must be given to making the administration of justice a reality in order to ensure that the important legal reforms have genuine substance.
Past experience in Latin America has shown that it is not enough to have modern laws guaranteeing human rights, because there is a kind of inertia which, due to certain legal practices, causes such laws, to a lesser or greater extent, to remain without effect except on paper.
In other words, laws which should regulate conduct fail to do so in practice, because they are applied not at all, partially, or in a distorted manner.
42. To illustrate this point, the Human Rights Division has undertaken a preliminary assessment of the problems affecting the application of existing rules which stipulate that anyone who is accused shall have the right to legal counsel and which provide for sanctions where this right has not been respected.
43. The amendments to the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, as well as to the Act organizing the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Legal Aid and Public Defenders Act adequately regulate the protection of the rights of the accused from the time of administrative detention, particularly his right to legal counsel as soon as extrajudicial proceedings have been instituted.
The reforms have institutionalized the Public Defender, assigning to the Office of the National State Counsel responsibility for providing legal aid and legal counsel for those of limited means.
44. However, the verification undertaken by ONUSAL has confirmed that, in practice, in many cases the accused still spends hours and days in police detention without the assistance of a lawyer.
On many occasions, judges fail to apply the rules in force; these rules are seldom applied as a matter of course.
Although the law stipulates that where the accused has not been assigned a defence lawyer, proceedings shall be declared invalid - which would appear to leave little scope for interpretation - it seems that, with a few exceptions, magistrates tend not to do so.
45. The following case is representative. In Chalatenango an application for the remedy of habeas corpus was filed on 7 May 1993 in respect of Jorge Osvaldo Salguera Villeda, who was awaiting trial in the Court of First Instance of Tejutla, on charges of aggravated larceny.
Among the documents in the file was a complaint by the defence counsel that the accused had been detained for 33 hours before being assigned a defence lawyer.
The application was rejected by both the executing officer and the magistrates, in open violation of the law.
One of the magistrates stated that, in his opinion, the fact that a defence counsel has not been appointed right from the start of the proceedings did not necessarily mean that the entire proceedings should be declared invalid.
46. There is sufficient evidence that the requirement established by the Code of Criminal Procedure that trials should be declared invalid if a defence lawyer has not been appointed is generally not being applied.
However, this situation could reflect a reluctance on the part of judges to apply the rule in circumstances where the police have acted improperly, prompted by a belief that it could allow many criminals to go unpunished.
This is a genuine risk, but its origins lie in the failure of the police to respect the rights of the accused rather than in the provision itself.
G. Right to freedom of expression
47. As was pointed out in the previous reports of the Human Rights Division, freedom of expression in El Salvador is a right generally guaranteed by the State.
In view of the current electoral situation in the country, the right to freedom of expression has a crucial role to play in ensuring that political rights can be properly exercised.
In this connection, freedom of expression must, in the interests of consistency, imply the need to adequately protect the right of reply and that of correction, particularly where respect of the rights or reputations of citizens is concerned, as laid down in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
48. The commitment undertaken in the peace agreements to achieve the goal of unity and national reconciliation, carries with it a duty not to use the media to encourage behaviour or values that run counter to the spirit of national reconciliation.
This requirement, which is crucial if the electoral process is to proceed in a harmonious climate reflecting the principles which have guided the peace process, is also set forth as an international obligation in article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
49. The Human Rights Division offers these comments in noting, as pointed out in its earlier reports, that clandestine organizations go so far as to make threats through the media, using paid inserts.
H. Political rights and right to identity documents
1. Political rights
50. Political rights continue to enjoy comprehensive protection and guarantees.
A report has been received which has been corroborated on the restriction of political rights (Case No. ORCH/696/93).
This situation must be corrected immediately, so that no military body has perceptions that are incompatible with the new function of the armed forces and that violate political rights.
51. The Human Rights Division wishes to draw attention to this fact, the possible recurrence of which could have a major impact on the free exercise of political rights.
Still more grave is the corroboration of politically motivated arbitrary executions or attempted executions which, in addition to representing a serious violation of the right to life, also constitute a direct and brutal violation of political rights, with regard to which the State cannot escape liability.
In the electoral context that the country is now entering, the State has an unavoidable obligation to investigate and punish those responsible in such cases.
2. Right to identity documents
52. The ONUSAL Human Rights Division has traditionally focused on the right to identity documents, since the effective exercise of that right is a fundamental prerequisite for the exercise of other basic rights, particularly political and civil rights.
53. On this premise, the Human Rights Division, in collaboration with various agencies - ISDEM, PRODOC, UNHCR, UNDP, AID, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) and mayors' offices, among others - has continued to support efforts to guarantee access by the Salvadorian people to identity documents.
54. During the period covered by this report substantial progress was made in issuing identity documents to the people.
A large number of identity document campaigns were conducted, coverage being extended to areas where there was a particularly serious problem.
55. Similarly coordination among the various authorities participating in the document-issuing process was improved, although further progress is needed.
This has allowed resources to be optimized and results improved to some extent.
So-called Identity Document Support Committees have been set up in various departments, with positive results.
56. Nevertheless the identity document campaigns have not had the expected impact nor met the actual needs.
While this can be attributed to various factors, including a lack of resources, it is clear that, a scant few months before the holding of elections, a high percentage of the population is still without basic identity documents and, thus, without the voting card needed to vote.
This situation is critical in the former conflict zones.
57. The Human Rights Division views this situation with concern and will increase its efforts to contribute to an effective solution.
I. The situation of violence and the enjoyment of human rights
58. Common violence continues to create a feeling of extreme insecurity among the population.
Beginning in February, the Government started to implement an emergency plan, but the results have not been as anticipated.
Execution of the plan has not led to any substantial improvement in the current situation. On 16 July the Government deployed, for an indefinite period, 3,000 armed forces troops in an anti-crime operation in support of operations by the National Police and the National Civil Police.
59. They were deployed at 20 critical crime points, in particular highways.
According to statements by the President of the Republic, Alfredo Cristiani, this step, in the Government's view, does not imply involvement by the armed forces in public security duties since the deployment is part of the routine training of armed forces personnel, who have no authority to make arrests or use their weapons other than in self-defence or in flagrante delicto arrests.
60. Non-governmental human rights organizations have expressed their opposition to this measure, warning of the creation of conditions conducive to the militarization of society.
In this connection the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General and Chief of the ONUSAL mission sent a letter to the Minister for the Presidency.
61. Although it is too early to analyse the results of the decision, first indications suggest that in itself it will not have a major impact on crime control, since, in essence, this requires the technical capacity to investigate and prosecute offences and the concomitantly speedy application of the penalties provided for under the law.
62. In any event ONUSAL reiterates the views expressed in its earlier reports that crime control, which is both necessary and essential, must strictly respect constitutional norms and the peace agreements, and must preserve the constitutional role of the armed forces, which are ordinarily excluded from public security functions.
63. There is widespread possession of military weapons by individuals.
There are periodic reports in the press of the discovery of hidden weapons and of smuggling in weapons and ammunition, as well as of the discovery of home-made weapons and of explosives abandoned in public areas.
Such events make all the more pressing the need for adequate legislation governing the possession of weapons in general and, in particular, the ad hoc procedures that must be adopted for the effective collection of military weapons held by the civilian population.
Further, the widespread possession of military weapons provides the material base for the emergence of organized crime structures, including death squads.
65. There have been some instances of selective non-political violence by members of communities affected by crime.
ONUSAL has verified deaths involving the execution of criminals by citizens.
Such was the case of Tulio Andrés Ramos Mercado, a former member of the Sixth Infantry Brigade, who after being accused of being an assailant, was captured by some 50 people and subsequently executed on 15 July in Usulután (Case No. SORU 421/93).
66. It is reasonable to suppose that the qualitative change in violence reflects factors carried over from the armed conflict which the country experienced; however, if military weapons were not so readily available, it could not have reached its current serious level.
Accordingly a comprehensive solution will involve not only disarming the civilian population, but also strengthening the institutions responsible for criminal investigation and the administration of justice, improving the living standards of the population affected by the conflict and providing suitable treatment for those who made warfare a way of life.
The violence in evidence today forms part of the transition towards the rule of law, which must be consolidated.
It is essential to tackle quickly the real causes of violence before it irreparably undermines the credibility of the institutions with constitutional responsibility for the suppression and punishment of crime.
67. Further, ONUSAL considers it important to develop means of building bridges between local communities and the institutions responsible for the investigation and punishment of crime.
An initial approach along these lines is being tried in Usulután, where members of the communities affected by crime have met with the National Police and the Office of the Attorney-General.
These meetings have demonstrated the willingness of the people to cooperate with the various government authorities in uniting against crime within the framework of the law.
Local communities are interested in cooperating with the police and judges, reporting crimes and supplying evidence to assist in solving them.
This approach is also intended to foster a sense of civic responsibility in prosecuting crime.
68. One situation which has been verified by ONUSAL, and which is extremely disquieting, is the fact that acts of organized violence are in many cases carried out by former members of the armed forces and the National Police.
At the same time, during the period covered by this report, it was confirmed that former FMLN members have also joined organized gangs of criminals.
There are indications to suggest that these groups, regardless of their nature, largely comprise former combatants from both sides as well as common criminals.
70. The existence of these armed groups, irrespective of their motivation, constitutes an expression of organized violence which must be punished in accordance with the law.
71. Some organized gangs engaged in common crime act in the name of former paramilitary organizations or death squads.
One such instance occurred in June, and involved the extortion of farmers by common criminals acting in the name of the self-styled "Maximiliano Hernández Martínez Commando".
72. ONUSAL has confirmed the presence of armed groups in the zone adjacent to the El Salvador volcano on the outskirts of the city of San Salvador.
Various reports have been received regarding the presence in that zone of armed individuals who engage in criminal activities.
The reports state that armed groups carry out acts of violence and terror against the owners and workers on the farms located in an area bordering the San Salvador volcano.
These occurrences, according to reports, take place in particular on the San Francisco farm.
73. Verification by ONUSAL indicates that these events have indeed been taking place, and are perpetrated by armed groups whose members usually wear black uniforms bearing the letters "VUN" and carry military weapons (M-16s).
Further information, which was corroborated during visits by ONUSAL observers, indicates that these armed groups comprise former FMLN combatants, who systematically harass owners and workers on the farms in the area.
74. In connection with this and other situations, FMLN, in a communiqué dated 15 June 1993, called for an investigation into the matter by the National Civil Police, with ONUSAL support, to identify these groups.
The communiqué also stated that once ONUSAL completed final verification of the surrender of weapons, possession of such weapons would be the sole responsibility of the individuals concerned.
IV. ACTIVE VERIFICATION OF OTHER COMMITMENTS ESTABLISHED IN
THE PEACE AGREEMENTS AND HAVING HUMAN RIGHTS AND
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT COMPONENTS
A. Functioning of the judiciary and the administration of justice
1. Judicial reform
Reform of the criminal justice system
75. On 16 June 1993 the Legislative Assembly adopted Legislative Decree No. 573 with the aim of guaranteeing judicial impartiality and separating the various stages of proceedings so as to bring them under the jurisdiction of different courts.
In this connection, one of the major reforms to the code of Criminal Procedure of El Salvador, is the replacement of article 19 by a new article, which grants magistrates courts jurisdiction in the case of preliminary hearings in respect of offences subject to ordinary jurisdiction committed within their territorial jurisdiction, up to cessation of proceedings or referral for trial, as well as jurisdiction in the case of minor offences and proceedings referred to them by courts of first instance and other courts.
It thus extends the sphere of competence of magistrates courts which will no longer be limited to functioning in the first phases of the preliminary hearings.
At the same time, criminal courts of first instance will have jurisdiction in cases involving offences subject to ordinary jurisdiction.
These reforms will come into force with effect from 7 September 1993.
2. Judicial reforms promoted by the Ministry of Justice
76. The substantive and sectoral reforms promoted by the Ministry of Justice are continuing through the participatory consultation stage, gathering the views of the legal community and the population.
This process represents a praiseworthy effort to make judicial reform a consensual and democratic process so as to endow it with the legitimacy essential to the attainment of its objectives.
In this connection the Ministry of Justice has proposed the text of the preliminary bill embodying the new Code of Criminal Procedure for national consultation.
3. The remedy of amparo
77. In its seventh report the Human Rights Division presented the conclusions of a study carried out with the aim of verifying the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of habeas corpus in Salvadorian judicial practice.
The conclusions established that, in terms of its current substantive and procedural regulation, habeas corpus is extremely ineffective in protecting fundamental individual rights.
78. With a similar objective an assessment has been conducted to determine the effectiveness of the remedy of amparo in judicial practice.
In terms of its comprehensiveness, amparo provides the most effective constitutional protection for human rights, since it applies to all rights.
The results of the study sample indicate that the situation with this remedy is similar to that of habeas corpus, in that it confirmed the ineffectiveness of the remedy in its current legislative form.
This means that the reform process must include a fundamental amendment to the legislation on amparo with the aim of ensuring its effectiveness and extending the scope of its protection.
79. The results of the above assessment suggest that the centralization of cases under the exclusive responsibility of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and the very nature of the procedure make it excessively complex and reduce the swiftness which should be a feature of amparo.
80. A total of 57 determinations made by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice in the first half of 1992 were analysed.
From the thrust of the judicial decisions concerning the amparo applications filed, it is clear that the number of decisions holding the remedy to be inapplicable (54.38 per cent), ordering a cessation of proceedings (24.56 per cent), declaring the application inadmissible (10.52 per cent) and denying the request (7.01 per cent) far outnumber those in which the application was upheld (3.50 per cent).
Based on this sample it is clear that the remedy is ineffective.
81. As to the rights invoked in the applications, most of the applications refer to the right to a hearing (21.05 per cent), the right to work (12.28 per cent), the right to ownership (12.28 per cent), the right to a defence (8.77 per cent), the right to possession (8.77 per cent) and the right to due process (1.75 per cent).
82. The Salvadorian juridical community has been developing various recommendations aimed at expediting the constitutional procedures relating to amparo actions, such as adopting the principle that applications can be filed orally and easing the current formal requirements for the filing of written complaints.
83. With regard to active legal standing, it has been recommended that the remedy of amparo be granted to anyone having a legitimate interest in protecting the right affected by the administrative act, and that recognition be given to the public right of action exercisable by State agencies or private bodies for the protection of collective or broad interests (associations, trade unions, chambers of commerce, non-governmental organizations, environmental organizations, etc.).
84. It would also be desirable for the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Office of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights to exercise their power to file amparo applications.
It is suggested that suspension of the act giving rise to the application would be appropriate, even if no harm has occurred, since the function of amparo is essentially preventive.
With regard to the exhaustion of ordinary or administrative remedies, it is also suggested that, in order to avoid deliberate procrastination, it should not be necessary to have exhausted all administrative remedies before applying for the remedy of amparo.
85. With regard to the human rights protected by the remedy of amparo, it is suggested that amparo should cover rights which have not been embodied in secondary legislation, which are part of international treaties that should form part of the domestic legal system.
86. Furthermore, the remedy should be extended to cover acts of individuals, and should be applicable against jurisdictional acts where guarantees of due process of law have been violated during a proceeding.
It should not be sought in order to resolve purely civil, labour or related matters, and should be recognized as an inalienable constitutional guarantee which, therefore, cannot be suspended during states of emergency.
B. The Office of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights
87. The Office of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights has been increasingly vigorous in carrying out its constitutional functions with regard to the protection and promotion of human rights.
88. During the period covered by this report, the National Counsel's Office, pursuant to its work plans and the recommendations of the Commission on the Truth, began opening departmental branches.
Of a total of seven branches which were to be established in 1993, two have opened, in San Vicente and Santa Ana.
The San Miguel departmental branch will open in August.
The others will be established during 1993, in accordance with the timetable submitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations by the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights.
89. With regard to the protection and defence of human rights, the National Counsel's Office has developed a project for monitoring and investigating human rights violations, geared to the establishment of an information and management system designed to improve its efficiency in protecting human rights; the project would be internationally funded, and its execution would require broad participation by non-governmental organizations.
90. The Office of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights in El Salvador was institutionally established by the peace agreements as a quasi-jurisdictional body for the monitoring of respect for human rights.
In the future, once the international verification process in El Salvador has been completed, the National Counsel's Office will assume sole responsibility for such monitoring.
Accordingly, strengthening this institution is of decisive importance for the establishment of a State governed by the rule of law and the fulfilment of the duty of citizens to exercise their rights in a lawful manner, as well as for the State's parallel obligation to safeguard those rights and to punish those responsible for any violation.
91. Such strengthening will have been achieved when the National Counsel's Office is materially and functionally able to systematically exercise all the powers granted to it by the Constitution and the Act organizing it, especially those relating to: the promotion of judicial or administrative remedies for the protection of human rights; the practice of making inspections where it so deems necessary for the protection of human rights; the supervision by the State of persons deprived of their liberty; the proposal to the organs of State of reforms aimed at the advancement of human rights; the drafting of views concerning bills which affect the exercise of human rights; the promotion of the signing and ratification of or accession to international human rights treaties; and, as a priority, the investigation, on its own initiative or upon receipt of a complaint, of cases involving human rights violations.
92. At the same time, the institutional and functional development of the National Counsel's Office in respect of the systematic exercise of its powers requires the gradual involvement of non-governmental human rights organizations as dynamic and active participants in all its activities.
93. It is also essential for the organs of State to fulfil the obligations arising from the constitutional powers of the National Counsel's Office.
These include: notifying the public prosecutor of all arrests; respecting the legal limits of administrative detention; dealing promptly, and in accordance with the norms of due process of law, with the judicial or administrative remedies that the public prosecutor's office may seek; taking the views of the National Counsel's Office into account in the drafting and adoption of legislation affecting human rights; agreeing to the reforms which the Office may propose to the organs of State; and implementing its recommendations.
The latter obligation is especially important inasmuch as some State institutions continue stubbornly to resist the recommendations of the National Counsel's Office.
94. On 29 July 1993, the ONUSAL Human Rights Division signed a cooperation agreement with the Office, with a view to contributing to the strengthening of that institution.
The agreement establishes the commitment of ONUSAL to transfer its functions to the Office upon completion of its mandate, and provides for cooperation in the following areas: monitoring and verification of human rights violations; techniques for investigating human rights violations; data-processing methodologies and media; establishment of a human rights information and documentation centre; institutional strengthening of the National Counsel's Office; support for the development, negotiation and execution of internationally-funded projects, and strengthening of the Office's external management.
C. Human rights components of the reform of the armed forces
and the security forces
95. The peace agreements established substantive commitments with regard to the operational structure of the armed forces.
The consent of the parties determined the assumption of obligations relating to the doctrinal principles of the armed forces, their educational system, a reduction in their personnel, a purification process and aspects relating to their organization.
These obligations, despite the emergence of difficulties which even led to modification of the time-limits initially agreed on, have been fulfilled in a manner consonant with the provisions of the agreements.
96. Consistent with this process, the Government, in issuing the general orders corresponding to 30 June 1990, implemented the recommendations of the ad hoc Commission by retiring those general officers whose discharge the Commission had recommended in its report, yet who were still in active service.
With this measure, the agreements relating to the armed forces have essentially been implemented.
Some of these agreements, as noted in previous reports, have human rights components, the implementation of which is, by its very nature, a continuing process.
97. The reforms which have been adopted with regard to the armed forces are of decisive importance for El Salvador's legal system and its political life in general.
A State governed by the rule of law - which is what the agreements seek to establish - implies, by definition, one with a political system in which the armed forces must be strictly limited to their very important constitutional functions and rigorously subordinated to civilian authority.
98. The institutional functions of the armed forces, as defined in the peace agreements and the constitutional reform, do not imply the diminishment of the military as an institution; on the contrary, the value of the military is enhanced in the context of a State governed by the rule of law and democratic life, in which the armed forces are required to be efficient and to have adequate capacity and resources for the fulfilment of their constitutional duties.
99. The agreements anticipated that the readjustment of the role of the armed forces in society and in the Salvadorian political system would mean a substantive change in the military doctrine, so as to adapt it to the new conditions of a situation of peace and the full operation of democratic life.
100. In accordance with articles 211, 212, 213 and 168 of the Constitution of the Republic of El Salvador, the armed forces belong to the executive branch and are under the authority of the President of the Republic as Commander-in-Chief.
Their specific mission is to defend the sovereignty of the State and the integrity of its territory; they may be used for the maintenance of internal peace only by express order of the President of the Republic and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
101. With the publication of the broad outlines of the new military doctrine, the obligation which the Government of El Salvador assumed in that regard has been fulfilled.
That fact should be assessed in the broader context of the fulfilment of other commitments which, together with the express formulation of the new doctrine, constitute a comprehensive and democratic reform of the armed forces.
The agreements which have already been implemented, include the reduction of 50.2 per cent in the personnel of the armed forces, the disbandment of the rapid deployment infantry battalions, the security forces and the paramilitary forces and the purification, all deriving from the conclusions of the ad hoc Commission.
This leaves the recommendations of the Commission on the Truth relating to the armed forces to be implemented, and consultations are currently under way on this subject.
102. These changes pertain to the legislative and institutional sphere.
In order for them to have legitimacy in the social sphere, the military and its individual members must adapt their conduct fully to the Constitution, the law and the spirit of the new doctrine.
The capacity of the institution itself, the State and the judiciary to investigate and punish, in accordance with the law, acts which run counter to the constitutional function of the military or which violate the norms of a State governed by the rule of law, will also contribute to that effort.
It is essential for some military authorities to refrain from assuming powers and competencies which are not conferred on them by law, such as those involving political investigation, detention and interference with the functioning of the organs of State.
2. Formation and functioning of the National Civil Police
103. The deployment of the National Civil Police (PNC) is continuing gradually, even though serious problems of financial and material resources, without which PNC may find it increasingly difficult to carry out its functions, have yet to be fully resolved.
104. In the context of the public security problems deriving from the increase in criminal acts, the constitutional, technical, ideal and most effective way to control and punish crime legally is to accelerate the formation and overall deployment of PNC, while providing it with the resources it requires to perform its tasks.
PNC has legitimacy and sufficient support among the population to inspire confidence in its ability to handle public security problems.
105. The initial results of the efforts of PNC confirm, moreover - despite sometimes dramatic material deficiencies - that it can efficiently tackle the fight against crime.
From that standpoint, and with a view to collaborating in the formation of PNC, the ONUSAL Human Rights Division and the National Public Security Academy signed a cooperation agreement which has already begun to be implemented.
D. Information and education campaign on human rights
106. Previous reports have underscored the importance which the Human Rights Division attaches to an information and education campaign on human rights in order to achieve a genuinely democratic and developed State.
107. Human rights education should not be limited to knowledge of human rights legislation or doctrine.
Over and above that undoubtedly important activity, human rights education should seek and should achieve changes in conduct - habits which can be instilled only if the theoretical content is accompanied by a type of education which is, in itself, respectful of human rights, in other words, a citizens' education encompassing the largest possible number of social activities.
108. From that standpoint, the Human Rights Division has launched an information and education campaign, to include television and radio broadcasts and pamphlet distribution during July and August 1993.
109. The campaign was designed, prepared and produced with a systematically participatory methodology, in consultation with various civilian sectors, the State and, especially, non-governmental organizations.
That made it possible to define, on the basis of consensus, the themes on which the campaign focuses, namely, arbitrary detentions for petty misdemeanours (faltas de policía); the relationship between the citizenry and the security forces; citizens' duties with regard to human rights; the protective role of non-governmental organizations; habeas corpus; the Office of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights; the National Civil Police; and equality of rights between women and men.
110. At the same time, the Human Rights Division is systematically continuing to hold events with the participation of judges, the juridical community, the police and the Office of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights.
In the field of formal education, 30,000 copies of the publication Normas nacionales e internacionales sobre derechos humanos have been delivered to the Ministry of Education for use by high-school teachers and students.
Moreover, the Presidential Commissioner for Human Rights has informed ONUSAL of the activities which his office is carrying out in the field of human rights education.
V. ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS DIVISION
111. In its seventh report, the Human Rights Division gave an account of the establishment of a mechanism for consultations between the Government of El Salvador and ONUSAL for the proper implementation of recommendations by the Human Rights Division.
At the same time, a list was made of the recommendations which the Government of El Salvador is responsible for implementing in accordance with provisions of the San José agreement.
112. In this connection, a concise assessment is given of the implementation process relating to the aforementioned recommendations:
1. Ratification of or accession to international instruments, including the Conventions of the International Labour Organisation mentioned in the sixth report.
Implementation:
The Government has expressed its willingness to ratify or accede very shortly, to the human rights conventions save for the one concerning recognition of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.
The Government has stated that the ILO Conventions will be dealt with within the framework of consultations held in the Forum for Economic and Social Consultation.
2. Structural and functional reform of the judiciary.
The implementation of this recommendation entails necessary constitutional reforms.
However, normative reforms are being carried out towards this end.
Those reforms which are particularly relevant are the substantive and sectoral reforms promoted by the Ministry of Justice.
Some of these reforms, such as elimination of the automatic reviews and amendments already adopted with respect to the public defender, have already been adopted by the Legislative Assembly.
Other amendments to the institution of habeas corpus and the draft new code of criminal procedure are being discussed with the legal community.
There are plans to adopt a new penal code and a code of penal procedure, as well as specific legislation to abolish extrajudicial confession, eliminate the presumption of guilt, shorten administrative detention, transfer petty misdemeanours from police jurisdiction to the magistrate's courts, introduce new regulations covering investigations and searches and amend the code of military justice.
3. Establishment of a special commission of inquiry to investigate arbitrary and extralegal executions.
The Government has stated that it is prepared to give priority to the investigation of cases brought to its attention by ONUSAL, as well as by non-governmental organizations, as possible summary or arbitrary executions.
At the same time it has stated that it would not be possible to establish a special commission, since the structure of the country's institutions does not allow for such investigative bodies.
Accordingly, it has been agreed that the main purpose of the recommendation, which is to ensure that investigations are independent, prompt and efficient as a means of avoiding impunity, will be borne in mind.
The efficiency of a mechanism whereby the Criminal Investigation Commission undertakes - independently of any proceedings which the relevant organs may be required to institute - to investigate cases of violent or presumed politically motivated deaths brought to the Government's attention by the Human Rights Division, is being explored.
Under this mechanism ONUSAL is to put before the Criminal Investigation Commission and the National Police, via the Minister for the Presidency and the Ministry of Justice, priority cases of deaths requiring prompt, independent and efficient investigation.
An account of these is to be found in the supplement to this report.
The initial experience with this procedure indicates that specific criteria - both technical and with respect to duration - must be established for investigations by the Criminal Investigation Commission, so that the investigations may fulfil the requirements of promptness, independence and efficiency, it being understood that, if they do not, it would mean the recommendation was not being implemented.
4. Amendment to the legislation governing remedies of habeas corpus and amparo to make them effective.
The Government has submitted to national debate a draft bill which amends the legislation regarding habeas corpus.
In general terms said draft is a positive step, although there may be further amendments to enhance its effectiveness.
The Human Rights Division will present to the Ministry of Justice an analysis of the above-mentioned draft with specific proposals.
Nevertheless, as has been stated in previous reports, and specifically in the recommendation on the subject, in order properly to guarantee the remedy of habeas corpus, constitutional reforms are needed in order to ensure that applicants have full access to the courts; at present this is limited to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court.
No initiative has yet been taken with respect to the remedy of amparo; the recommendation consequently has yet to be implemented.
5. Establishment of a compensation fund for victims of human rights violations.
Preliminary steps have been taken to implement this recommendation; they include an examination of different modalities for the establishment of the fund, such as criteria for determining the number of potential beneficiaries and the identification of the necessary financial resources.
The CDHES plan contains many constructive and suitable elements which should be taken into account; the Human Rights Division considers that implementation of this recommendation is a matter of urgency that can no longer be postponed.
6. Improvement of the composition and powers of the National Council of the Judiciary and independence of the Judicial Training School.
This recommendation entails amending the Act on the National Council of the Judiciary and also the Constitution.
Nothing has been done as yet to implement it.
7. Elimination of extrajudicial confession.
With the new Public Defenders Act and the amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure and to the Act organizing the Public Prosecutor's Office, regulating the right of the accused to legal defence, the practice of extrajudicial confession has decreased.
Nevertheless, the Ministry of Justice has submitted a preliminary bill specifically prohibiting extrajudicial confessions, and designed also to safeguard the constitutional provision which provides that statements obtained against the will of the individual shall be invalid and that anyone who obtains and uses such statements shall be held criminally liable.
The purpose of this text is to protect the right of the accused not to be forced to incriminate himself or herself, and to disallow the use of extrajudicial confession as evidence.
Once this bill is adopted, after it has been discussed with the legal community and submitted to the Legislative Assembly, this recommendation will have been implemented.
There will, however, remain one additional task, namely, monitoring the effective implementation of the laws by the police and judges.
8. Definition of torture and enforced disappearance as offences in special criminal legislation.
The preliminary bill of a new Penal Code submitted by the Minister of Justice defines torture as an offence against the fundamental right to security and integrity of person.
It likewise defines enforced disappearance as an offence, stating that any official who legally or illegally detains an individual without indicating the latter's whereabouts shall be liable to imprisonment from four to eight years, a fine for a period of 180 to 250 days at the prescribed rate and general disqualification for a period of six to ten years, providing that the offence is not one punishable by a heavier penalty.
The bill defines the offences of enforced disappearance proper, enforced disappearance carried out by individuals following orders and enforced disappearance entailing culpable responsibility for allowing or agreeing to the commission of the offence.
Implementation of the recommendation began with the initiative of the Ministry of Justice; implementation will be completed once the relevant corresponding legislation has been adopted.
9. Legislation regulating the conduct of law enforcement officials in terms of ensuring respect for human rights.
The Ministry of Justice has drafted a preliminary bill concerning regulations for administrative detention aimed at averting excess and abuse in the use of force during detention by adopting the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, as part of domestic legislation.
The passing of this preliminary bill will mean that the corresponding recommendation is being implemented; other partial reforms, such as those referred to in the regulation covering investigations and searches, will also contribute to this objective.
Once the corresponding legislation has been passed after consultation with the legal community and the citizenry, it will be indispensable to set up machinery for cooperation and evaluation of its implementation with the Civil Police, the National Police and the Anti-Drug-Trafficking Unit.
10. Abolition of the practice of arbitrary detention for petty misdemeanours.
ONUSAL has been encouraging implementation of this recommendation in coordination with the National Police, the National Civil Police, the Supreme Court and the municipalities.
Towards this end, certain verification procedures have been worked out and a set of instructions have been issued to the police force to decrease the number of such arbitrary detentions while legislative reforms are being adopted.
Assessment of the implementation of the instructions indicates that implementation is not yet satisfactory.
A programme to encourage proper implementation has been developed in cooperation with the courts.
Similar action is to be taken with the municipalities.
Arbitrary detention for petty misdemeanours is the main cause of the violation of the right to liberty in this country.
By dealing with the problems and shortcomings identified in the execution of the instructions it will be possible to move towards reducing the high incidence of arbitrary detention. However implementation of the recommendation requires, as a matter of urgency, the repeal of the Police Act of 1896 and adoption of the preliminary bills on regulations governing detention by the police authorities and transfer of petty misdemeanours from police jurisdiction to the magistrate's courts.
11. Temporary application of the Act governing the procedure for administrative detention or the imposition of administrative fines.
This recommendation is linked to the previous one as a temporary means of lowering the high incidence of arbitrary detentions for petty misdemeanours.
The police instructions regarding misdemeanours were designed with a view to applying the Act governing the procedure for administrative detention or the imposition of administrative fines (Legislative Decree No. 457) instead of resorting to obsolete provisions of the Police Act of 1886 or illegal proceedings.
Although marked progress has been made, the Act is not being adequately implemented as yet.
A programme for the National Civil Police, the National Police, the Municipal Police, and the Anti-Drug-Trafficking Unit must be set up as a matter of urgency in order to establish that, during the transition period prior to repeal of the Police Act of 1886 and the transfer of petty misdemeanour cases from police jurisdiction to the magistrate's courts, the provisions of Legislative Decree No. 457 must be applied in cases of administrative arrest.
12. Amendment to the disciplinary regime under the Career Judicial Service Act so that the Supreme Court of Justice or its President can investigate formally any irregularities or violations of due process.
ONUSAL has been holding consultations with the Supreme Court of Justice on the implementation of this recommendation which is essential in assuring the effectiveness of the guarantees of due legal process, especially vis-à-vis the right to legal counsel, the right to be tried by a competent tribunal within a reasonable period of time and the right to a fair trial.
13. Legal recognition of associations and trade unions.
Although some progress has been achieved under the consultation mechanism, this recommendation has yet to be implemented.
14. Visit by the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association.
The Committee will undertake the proposed visit to El Salvador pursuant to the recommendation.
15. Inclusion of a human rights component as a substantive and permanent feature of military training.
This recommendation, which is already being implemented must, by its very nature, be a continuing process.
In this regard, the Human Rights Division will submit a specific cooperation programme to the Armed Forces.
16. Recovery of weapons which are intended exclusively for Armed Forces personnel but which are in the possession of individuals and tighter monitoring of the use of arms by military officers in active service.
Notwithstanding the steps taken, this recommendation has yet to be implemented because of the ineffectiveness of the measures; as a result, a situation which is propitious to human rights violations still persists.
Legislation must be drafted to define the legal framework for the possession of weapons and empower the competent authorities to collect weapons in the possession of the civilian population.
17. Budget autonomy for the Office of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights.
This recommendation should be implemented in accordance with the general rules governing the auditing of State accounts.
However, consultations between the Government and the Office with regard to its implementation have not yet begun.
18. Lifting of any restrictions on NGO activities and support for their work programmes.
The legal status of some non-governmental organizations is still undetermined.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
1. During the three months under review, there have been definite improvements as well as serious violations in the human rights situation; this is evidenced by the persistence of the alarming trends with respect to the right to life, the confirmation of one case of torture that must not go unpunished and by the fact that once again no disappearances have occurred, the latter being the most tangible proof of progress.
The perpetrators of human rights violations, especially the right to life, still go unpunished in a substantial number of cases.
This is all the more serious when those involved are members of the armed forces, the police or State organs.
This situation casts doubts on the State's ability to guarantee respect for human rights.
2. Politically motivated human rights violations have been more open and are rendered more serious because of the electoral context the country has entered.
3. At the same time, common violence and an unfavourable climate for the protection of human rights have created a complex and precarious situation characterized by the presence of a hodgepodge of armed groups and gangs that must be investigated and punished according to the law.
4. In this regard, the various State bodies and civilian society will have to reaffirm the consensus, conciliation and spirit of reconciliation not only as a substantive goal of the peace but also as daily components of political life and social intercourse.
5. The generally positive trends that the peace has brought about in the area of human rights are not yet - they could not be - irreversible.
Such trends can endure only if the institutions established as a result of the peace function effectively, if State institutions observe the law scrupulously, if the judiciary has the authority and autonomy to carry out investigations and mete out appropriate punishment, if the Office of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights is strengthened and its constitutional functions respected by State agencies and if civilian society is strengthened; non-governmental organizations must play a key role in the latter process.

FINANCING OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE PROSECUTION OF
PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL
HUMANITARIAN LAW COMMITTED IN THE TERRITORY OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA SINCE 1991
Report of the Fifth Committee
Rapporteur: Mr. Jorge OSELLA (Argentina)
I. INTRODUCTION
1. At its 104th plenary meeting, on 28 May 1993, the General Assembly, on the proposal of the Secretary-General (A/47/955), decided to include in the agenda of its forty-seventh session an item entitled "Financing of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991" and to allocate it to the Fifth Committee.
2. The Fifth Committee considered this item at its 70th, 72nd and 76th meetings, on 25 and 27 August, and 10 September 1993.

Jericho Malaysia welcomes the decision reached between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel on mutual recognition as well as the historic agreement for a Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza-Jericho occupied territories signed in Washington on 13 September 1993.
We view these latest events as a positive and forward movement in the long and arduous search for a comprehensive, just and durable solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Malaysia has consistently urged for an early resolution of the Palestinian problem based on justice and through negotiations.
In this context, we have lent our support to the Middle East peace process and have called all parties concerned to demonstrate the necessary political will and good faith in resolving the conflict.
Malaysia has consistently and firmly supported the Palestinian cause and we hope this agreement is the first step towards the building of mutual confidence that would ultimately provide the solution of the Palestinian issue within the framework of the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, in particular resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which provide for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination and to a homeland and the security of all States, including Israel.
Malaysia would also like to take this opportunity to commend the Palestinian leadership for its realistic and courageous act in leading the Palestinian people towards a new and promising future.
We are confident that the PLO and Israel, as well as other Arab States in the Middle East, will build on this initial success and continue to strive to bring about a new era of long-lasting peace, stability and prosperity to the region.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship expresses its satisfaction at the agreement on mutual recognition reached by the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
This agreement marks the beginning of an era of peace in the Middle East, which has been long awaited by the international community.
The compromise between Israelis and Palestinians reflects a new spirit of justice and cooperative dialogue among nations which, for historical reasons, have been in a state of confrontation.
The mutual acceptance of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war, and the need to work for a just and lasting peace and to terminate all military activity, proposed in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) is, undoubtedly, a highly significant step towards a new order in international relations.
This event is a historic lesson in the search for solutions in regions where the painful legacy of history continues to hinder development, justice, coexistence and true friendship among peoples and Governments.
In keeping with its pacifist policy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship declares that it will continue to support efforts to strengthen peace in the Middle East, in accordance with the norms of international law and justice, which should prevail in international relations.
Through this Ministry, and on the occasion of this historic event, the Government of Bolivia, shares the satisfaction of Bolivian citizens of Israeli and Palestinian descent.

6. In the light of developments in Cambodia, the Secretary-General also submitted special reports on 12 June 1992 5/ and 14 July 1992. 6/
7. In subsequent resolutions of the Security Council (resolutions 783 (1992) of 13 October 1992 and 792 (1992) of 30 November 1992), the Secretary-General was requested, inter alia, to report to the Council on the implementation of those resolutions and on any further measures that might be necessary and appropriate to ensure the realization of the fundamental objectives of the Paris Agreements.
Pursuant to those requests, the Secretary-General submitted reports to the Security Council on 15 November 1992 7/ and 13 February 1993 8/ which were endorsed and approved by the Council in its resolutions 792 (1992) of 30 November 1992 and 810 (1993) of 8 March 1993, respectively.
8. In paragraph 18 of its resolution 792 (1992), the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to consider the implications for the electoral process of the failure of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea (PDK) to canton and demobilize its forces and, in response to that situation, to take all appropriate steps to ensure the successful implementation of the electoral process.
9. In paragraph 19 of that resolution, the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to investigate and report upon the implications for security in post-election Cambodia of the possible incomplete implementation of the disarmament and demobilization provisions of the Paris Agreements.
10. By its resolution 810 (1993), the Security Council endorsed the decision by the Supreme National Council that the election for the constituent assembly would be held from 23 to 27 May 1993.
11. In paragraph 6 of that resolution, the Security Council called on UNTAC to continue to make every effort to create and maintain a neutral political environment conducive to the holding of free and fair elections, and requested the Secretary-General to inform the Council by 15 May 1993 of the conditions and preparations for the elections.
Pursuant to that request, the Secretary-General submitted a report to the Council on 15 May 1993, 9/ which was approved by the Council in its resolution 826 (1993) of 20 May 1993.
12. In paragraph 10 of its resolution 826 (1993), the Security Council called on UNTAC to continue to work in accordance with resolution 810 (1993) to ensure a neutral political environment conducive to the holding of free and fair elections.
13. In paragraph 16 of that resolution, the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to report promptly to it on the holding and results of the election, including on the conduct of the parties regarding their obligations under the Paris Agreements and, if necessary, to recommend any initiative and/or measures conducive to ensuring their full respect by all parties.
14. By paragraph 2 of its resolution 835 (1993) of 2 June 1993, the Security Council invited the Secretary-General to make his report on the elections available as soon as possible.
16. By its resolution 840 (1993), the Security Council endorsed the results of the election, which had been certified free and fair by the United Nations.
17. In paragraph 7 of that resolution, the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to report to it by the middle of July, including on his recommendations on the possible role the United Nations and its agencies might play after the end of the mandate of UNTAC according to the Paris Agreements.
18. It is recalled that, by its resolution 47/209 of 22 December 1992, the General Assembly decided to appropriate, in accordance with the recommendation contained in paragraph 62 of the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/47/763), an amount of $483,961,200 gross ($470,808,500 net) for the continued operation of UNTAC for the period from 1 November 1992 to 30 April 1993.
This was in addition to the amount of $839,576,200 gross ($833,171,300 net) already appropriated for UNAMIC and UNTAC.
19. By its resolution 47/209, the General Assembly decided that the unencumbered balance of $162,345,800 gross ($160,941,000 net) in respect of the period from 1 November 1991 to 31 October 1992 would be set off against the apportionment among Member States.
20. In paragraph 7 of that resolution, the General Assembly authorized the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for the operations of UNTAC at a rate not to exceed $241,841,300 gross ($235,823,600 net) for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993, subject to obtaining the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee.
21. In a letter dated 13 April 1993 to the Chairman of the Advisory Committee, the Controller indicated that the full commitment authorization for the three-month period from 1 May to 31 July 1993 provided for under General Assembly resolution 47/209 would be required, in addition to the unencumbered balance remaining from the appropriations provided for UNTAC.
The concurrence of the Advisory Committee was therefore sought in the amount of $241,841,300 gross ($235,823,600 net), together with the unencumbered balance of appropriations of $6,606,700 gross ($3,297,600 net) for the continued operation of UNTAC through 31 July 1993.
22. In a letter dated 13 April 1993, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee informed the Secretary-General that the Committee concurred in the request to enter into commitments in an amount not exceeding $236 million gross for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993.
23. In paragraph 12 of its resolution 47/209, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit to it at its forty-eighth session a detailed performance report on the budget of UNTAC, including the planned disposal of the assets of the operation.
The present report is submitted to the Assembly at its forty-seventh session rather than its forty-eighth session, as requested, in order to make appropriate provision for the additional requirements of UNTAC for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993, and for the one-month period beyond 31 July 1993.
Appropriate provision would also be required for the costs associated with the liquidation phase of the UNTAC operation.
II. ACTIVITIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS TRANSITIONAL AUTHORITY
24. Progress achieved by each component of UNTAC, as detailed in the third 3/ and fourth 4/ progress reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council, is summarized below.
A. Progress achieved by each component
1. Human rights component
25. In pursuance of its basic mandate, UNTAC continued to expand its human rights education and training programmes both in Phnom Penh and in the provinces, with particular reference to teacher training, dissemination of relevant international instruments, education of health professionals, training of public and political officials and support for local human rights organizations.
2. Electoral component
26. Registration of voters, which began in October 1992, was completed on 31 January 1993.
The number of registered voters reached nearly 4.7 million, or some 96 per cent of the estimated eligible population.
On the basis of the number of registered voters, 120 seats for the Constituent Assembly had been allocated to the 21 provinces and the Phnom Penh special district.
27. A total of 20 out of the 22 provisionally registered political parties had applied for official party registration in accordance with the Electoral Law.
28. Polling stations were divided into large, medium or small static stations - consisting of eight, six and three polling teams respectively - as well as mobile stations.
It was planned that each polling station would have a Cambodian Presiding Officer in charge and one International Polling Station Officer to provide support and assist the Presiding Officer.
Approximately 1,000 international polling station officers from more than 30 countries would be recruited.
3. Military component
29. The refusal of PDK to participate in the cantonment and demobilization process had made it necessary to adjust the deployment of the military component, with a view to enhancing the ability of UNTAC to protect voter registration and, subsequently, the electoral and polling processes, particularly in remote or insecure areas.
In order to accomplish this, the deployment pattern of the military component had been realigned to conform with the deployment of electoral teams and shorten the time taken to respond to potential threats to them.
The new deployment was completed on 31 December 1992.
31. As a result of attacks on UNTAC military and civilian personnel, all units of the military component in all locations were directed to enhance their security measures and procedures.
The defensive positions of the military component were expanded to allow the construction of bunkers and overhead protection as well as firing bays.
Permanent guards and/or mobile patrols were used to improve the physical security of premises where UNTAC assets are located in isolated locations.
Security at UNTAC headquarters had also been strengthened by heightening the walls around the compound and by improving the illumination along the walls.
32. The five engineering units of UNTAC, supplemented by the engineer platoons in 11 of the 12 infantry battalions, have repaired hundreds of bridges and improved scores of kilometres of roads, as well as airfields at Pochentong (Phnom Penh) and Stung Treng.
33. In the past year, the Mine Clearance Training Unit was instrumental in clearing more than 1.6 million square metres of land and disposing of more than 15,000 mines and other pieces of unexploded ordnance.
4. Civil administration component
34. Progress had been achieved in the further development of the expenditure control procedure, the establishment of a border control mechanism, the planning of specialized control operations in telecommunications and civil aviation and the measures taken to promote a neutral political environment.
As the election approached, emphasis was placed on preventing the use of personnel and premises of local authorities for partisan political purposes.
5. Civilian police component
35. Much of the daily work of the civilian police component had been focused on the supervision or control of local police activities.
During the period, UNTAC civilian police provided basic police training for the three Cambodian factions cooperating with UNTAC.
In addition, the component undertook a comprehensive study of the size, organization and equipment of the police forces of the three cooperating factions.
36. UNTAC civilian police had also been closely involved with other activities relating to the establishment and maintenance of acceptable conditions for the conduct of free and fair elections and to contribute to security arrangements for the election.
6. Repatriation component
37. The repatriation of some 360,000 refugees and displaced persons was completed by 30 April 1993.
All eligible Cambodian refugees and displaced persons were given the opportunity to be registered for elections on their return to their homeland.
7. Rehabilitation component
38. The rehabilitation component, in close coordination with UNTAC military observers, civil administration and civilian police personnel deployed at border checkpoints, continued to monitor the extent of compliance with the moratorium on the export of timber adopted by the Supreme National Council on 22 September 1992.
39. In addition to the total of 35 rehabilitation projects worth $340 million approved in 1992, the Supreme National Council approved a further 10 projects worth about $26 million.
However, by March 1993 only about $100 million of the $880 million pledged at the Ministerial Conference on the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Cambodia held at Tokyo in June 1992 had been disbursed.
B. Implementation of Security Council resolutions
1. Implementation of Security Council resolution 792 (1992)
41. In view of the increasing acts of political and ethnic violence, in addition to measures described in paragraphs 29 to 31 above, the civilian police and military components of UNTAC instituted intensive patrols and static guard duty to improve the security of political party offices.
42. In order to foster a neutral political environment conducive to the holding of free and fair elections, UNTAC announced that it would give priority to protecting three freedoms, namely, freedom from intimidation, freedom of party affiliation and freedom of action for political parties.
43. By paragraphs 10, 12, 13 and 14 of its resolution 792 (1992), the Security Council adopted a number of measures concerning border control and the protection of the natural resources of Cambodia.
In accordance with those provisions, UNTAC appealed to neighbouring countries to assist in the implementation of the moratorium on the export of timber.
UNTAC also deployed border control teams to monitor closely any violations of the moratorium by land or sea.
44. In the broader context of border control, civil administration staff of UNTAC had been deployed to monitor other areas such as customs and immigration control.
The 23 checkpoints in operation were each manned by an UNTAC team comprising military observers, armed soldiers and civilian police with communication support facilities.
45. With regard to the elections for the Constituent Assembly, it was planned that voting would be at fixed polling stations.
In order to ensure that every registered voter had the chance to vote, it was envisaged that two additional days of voting at mobile polling stations would be required.
It was therefore anticipated that the polling would take place from 23 to 27 May 1993.
However, following further intensive study, UNTAC concluded that the reorganization of polling staff from static to mobile teams would itself require a full day.
On this basis, it was decided that polling would be extended until 28 May.
46. The Paris Agreements provide for the Constituent Assembly to complete, within a period of three months after the elections, its tasks of drafting and adopting a new Cambodian Constitution and transforming itself into a legislative assembly, which will form a new Cambodian Government.
During the interim period between the elections and the formation of the new Government, should the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General in implementing the cantonment and demobilization procedures fail, it would be necessary to keep the military and civilian police components of UNTAC in existence.
Appropriate recommendations to the Security Council would be submitted by the Secretary-General in that connection.
2. Implementation of paragraph 6 of Security Council resolution 810 (1993)
47. The activities of UNTAC relating to the conditions and preparations for the elections, in pursuance of paragraph 6 of Security Council resolution 810 (1993) and as detailed in the report of the Secretary-General, 9/ are summarized below.
48. As at 15 May 1993, technical preparations for the election had been virtually completed.
Some 900 international polling station officers were recruited from 44 countries, joined by 130 staff members of the United Nations Secretariat and about 370 detailed from within UNTAC to perform their duties as described in section I.D of the fourth progress report of the Secretary-General. 4/
49. Attacks against UNTAC personnel continued.
From the inception of UNTAC until 15 May 1993, 13 UNTAC civilian and military personnel have lost their lives and 52 have been wounded as a result of hostile action; 39 have died from other causes.
50. In the light of the repeatedly expressed intention of PDK to oppose the election, including by violent means, and in response to the continuing acts of violence by various elements, it was decided that no polling would be conducted in the areas controlled by PDK, and some remote areas in which the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea (NADK) had been operating.
51. Other parts of the country had been designated as high-, medium- and low-risk zones.
It was planned that in high-risk zones armed UNTAC military personnel would be stationed at and around polling stations.
Physical fortifications had been strengthened and staff would be issued protective gear.
Quick reaction forces and medical support units had been identified for the high-risk sites.
52. In order further to strengthen security during the election, urgent consultations had been held with a number of Governments on the provision of additional equipment for UNTAC.
Additional material assistance had been provided by the Governments of Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Namibia, Singapore and the United States of America, as detailed in annex IV, section B, to the present report.
Essential items for enhanced security had been shipped to the mission.
53. Although it was foreseen that UNTAC would be conducting the most impartial election that would be possible in conditions that were not susceptible to its full control, it was clear to the Secretary-General that it was the will and intent of the Security Council and of the vast majority of the Cambodian people that the election be held as scheduled.
The Secretary-General therefore decided that this should be done.
III. CONDUCT AND RESULTS OF THE ELECTIONS IN CAMBODIA
54. The conduct and results of the elections in Cambodia as detailed in the report of the Secretary-General, 10/ are summarized below.
55. The elections were held as scheduled from 23 to 28 May 1993 in all 21 provinces in Cambodia.
Between 23 and 25 May, some 1,400 large, medium and small fixed polling stations were operating, as well as 200 mobile teams in remote or difficult country.
The mobile teams operated for the entire six-day period, while on 26 May some of the fixed stations were converted to mobile operation and worked as mobile teams on 27 and 28 May.
56. A total of 4,267,192 voters, representing 89.56 per cent of the registered voters, turned out to vote.
57. Three of the four Cambodian parties signatories to the Paris Agreements took part in the electoral process.
The fourth Cambodian signatory party failed to register as a political party, took no part in the election and threatened to disrupt it with violence.
The polling was generally peaceful, however, and no significant disruption occurred.
58. The number of votes cast for each party and the percentage of total votes won are contained in annex I to the report of the Secretary-General. 10/
59. At a meeting of the Supreme National Council, convened on 10 June 1993, the day after the counting of the ballots had been completed, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Cambodia declared on behalf of the Secretary-General and on behalf of the United Nations that, in view of the very high turnout throughout the country, the absence of violence or disruption during the polling, the success of the technical conduct of the poll and the calm atmosphere that reigned throughout the polling period, the election as a whole had been free and fair.
The text of the statement made by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at that meeting is reproduced in annex II to the report of the Secretary-General. 10/
OF CAMBODIA
60. Cambodia is emerging from two decades of armed conflict.
The successful elections held in May represent a major step forward, towards peace, democracy and national reconciliation.
Yet much remains to be done if the objectives of the international community are to be achieved.
A viable, democratic government will need to be constituted from factions that were in armed conflict with each other only a short while ago.
This can only occur if all concerned shift their loyalties and allegiances from the factions to the constitution and the government established in accordance with the constitution.
The establishment of the joint interim administration is an encouraging beginning to this process.
One perception that remains, however, is that the livelihood of individuals in the public sector depends on their continued loyalty to past associations.
61. The structural weakness of the finances of the State of Cambodia party has meant that their officials have not been able to meet budget expenditure from current revenue even when such expenditure was reduced to the bare minimum.
During the past year they have sought to cope with this problem in two ways: they have fallen into arrears with respect to payments (in particular of salaries); and they have printed and issued currency.
The first option has contributed to the deterioration in the performance of the civil service that has been observed in recent months.
The second has led directly to an increase in the money supply and to price inflation.
The joint interim administration will inherit the structural weakness of the State of Cambodia party and must begin immediately to improve its capacity to generate revenue.
This will inevitably take some time, however, and in the meantime the new administration should have available to it the option of meeting minimal expenditure without provoking inflation.
Proposed action by UNTAC
62. It is proposed that assistance to the joint interim administration should be provided from the budget of UNTAC.
Such assistance would allow the following operational activities to be undertaken:
(a) Unifying the procedures for dealing with civil servants in the three zones administered by the three factions participating in the Constituent Assembly;
(b) Extending the use of the riel into those zones in which it has not hitherto been used;
(c) Engaging in training on the duties of public-sector employees in a multi-party democracy;
(d) Setting in motion the process of rationalizing and streamlining organizational structures and of reducing public sector employment;
(e) Meeting the most essential and pressing items of current expenditure in July and August without resorting to currency issuance.
63. UNTAC would be directly involved in all of the above-mentioned activities.
In addition, it would continue and intensify, as necessary, its exercise of direct control of finance.
That includes, in particular, the control of the central bank, finance ministry, treasury, customs department and provincial finance departments and treasuries.
UNTAC currently has staff working in those agencies who follow operations on a daily basis, and whose approval is required before expenditure and other key operations can be undertaken.
With regard to the defence and security ministries, an elaboration of control procedures is under way that would involve UNTAC military and police, as well as financial controllers, in the close supervision of major financial operations.
Magnitude of support
64. The required magnitude of financial support was calculated on the basis of actual revenue and expenditure out-turns for the three administrative structures for the first quarter of 1993.
For all structures, this was a time of acute budget stringency: in the case of the State of Cambodia party, for example, actual expenditure during the first quarter reached only 60 per cent of what had been budgeted.
The actual out-turn for the quarter can therefore be taken as a reasonable approximation of minimal expenditure requirements.
The riel amounts for various expenditure items were then adjusted for the loss in purchasing power of the riel that has occurred since the end of the first quarter.
This resulted, by and large, in a doubling of nominal riel expenditure.
65. Revenue was estimated on the basis of the first quarter out-turn, taking into account more recent trends and measures being put in place to enhance revenue performance.
Overall expenditure was then compared to overall revenue.
The outcome is a monthly deficit that reaches CR 34.6 billion, or $9.9 million (at an exchange rate of CR 3,500 per dollar).
The magnitude of assistance required for July and August is thus $20 million.
Of this amount, $3 million will be met from the Trust Fund for the Cambodian Peace Process.
The amount required from the UNTAC budget is thus $17 million.
V. STATUS OF ASSESSED CONTRIBUTIONS
66. The status of assessed contributions, received and unpaid as at 30 June 1993, is summarized in the table.
Total outstanding assessments of $290,533,100 are due from Member States for UNAMIC ($4,645,300) and UNTAC ($285,887,800).

VI. VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS
67. In paragraph 10 of its resolution 47/209, the General Assembly invited Member States to make voluntary contributions to UNTAC in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General.
For the period ending on 30 June 1993, voluntary contributions received by UNTAC consisted of (a) a cash contribution of $1.1 million from the Government of Japan towards the expenses for the reinforcement of security measures undertaken by UNTAC; and (b) a cash contribution of $25,807 from the Government of New Zealand for the air fare of international polling station officers.
These services and supplies have been budgeted for.
VII. STATUS OF REIMBURSEMENTS TO TROOP-CONTRIBUTING STATES
68. Troops are currently being provided to UNTAC by 25 Governments, namely, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Namibia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.
69. As a result of delays in payment of assessed contributions by certain Member States, UNTAC has been unable to meet its obligations on a current basis, particularly those due to the troop-contributing countries, payments to which have not been made on a current basis in accordance with the rates established by the General Assembly.
70. Full reimbursement in accordance with standard rates of reimbursement has been made to those Governments only up the period ending on 31 January 1993.
The estimated amounts due to troop-contributing States for troop costs for the period from 1 February to 31 May 1993 are as follows:
Thousands of United States dollars (rounded)
Pay and allowances 57 828.6
Allowance for specialists 2 499.8
Usage factor for personal clothing, gear and equipment 4 097.2
Total 64 425.6

71. The appropriations provided for the combined operations, UNAMIC and UNTAC, for the period from 1 November 1991 to 30 April 1993, are set out by budget line in annex I. Supplementary information thereon is provided in annex II. The total apportionment will amount to $1,161,191,600 gross ($1,143,038,800 net).
Of these, the amount of $20,023,200 gross ($19,777,200 net) relates specifically to UNAMIC as indicated in the earlier reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of UNAMIC and UNTAC (A/46/903, A/47/733).
IX. REVISED REQUIREMENTS OF THE UNITED NATIONS TRANSITIONAL
AUTHORITY IN CAMBODIA FROM 1 MAY TO 31 JULY 1993 AND
COST ESTIMATES FROM 1 TO 31 AUGUST 1993
72. The revised requirements for the three-month period from 1 May to 31 July 1993 amount to $301,181,600 gross ($292,829,700 net), representing an increase of $65,181,600 gross ($59,023,100 net) over the reduced commitment authorization of $236 million.
The concurrence of the Advisory Committee in the request to enter into commitments in an amount not exceeding $236 million gross for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993 was contained in the Chairman's letter dated 13 April 1993 to the Secretary-General.
The requirements for the one-month period from 1 to 31 August 1993 amount to $68,527,700 gross ($66,896,800 net).
A summary of the revised estimates for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993 is presented in annex III (column 2) and the estimate for the month of August 1993 is summarized in column 3 of the same annex.
Supplementary information thereon is contained in annex IV. The proposed civilian staffing table is shown in annex V.
X. COST ESTIMATES FOR THE INITIAL STAGE OF THE LIQUIDATION PHASE
OF THE UNITED NATIONS TRANSITIONAL AUTHORITY IN CAMBODIA
73. It is projected that the liquidation phase of UNTAC will take 10 months to complete.
The costs associated with the initial stage of the liquidation phase, that is, for the period from 1 September to 31 December 1993, are presented in annex VI, and supplementary information in annex VII.
AUTHORITY IN CAMBODIA
74. The proposals of the Secretary-General for the disposition of the property of UNTAC upon the completion of its mandate are set out in annex VIII to the present report.
A summary table listing UNTAC assets potentially available by 1 August 1993 is shown in appendix I to annex VIII, and supplementary information thereon in appendix II. The table shows the initial value of the assets as well as the residual value at the time of eventual disposition.
The residual values have been established through the application of depreciation scales which were developed by UNTAC.
The rationale used in developing the depreciation scales is presented in appendix II.
75. The Secretary-General has expressed his deep satisfaction in supporting his Special Representative's determination that the election in Cambodia was free and fair.
In his latest report on the conduct and results of the elections in Cambodia, 10/ he has indicated that UNTAC will give the Constituent Assembly full support in the process of drawing up a constitution and establishing a new Government for all Cambodia.
76. Pursuant to paragraph 7 of Security Council resolution 840 (1993), the Secretary-General will report to the Council by the middle of July 1993 on his recommendations on the possible role the United Nations and its agencies might play after the end of the mandate of UNTAC according to the Paris Agreements.
77. In conclusion, the Secretary-General has expressed his confidence that the international community will continue to support efforts to promote national reconciliation and peace-building in Cambodia.

The total cost amounted to $11 million.
4. Infrastructure repairs . 13 166 700
5. Transport operations . (291 100)
The additional requirements of $2,779,700 for the purchase of vehicles were due solely to losses on currency exchange rates in the liquidation of obligations.
The over-expenditure under rental of vehicles was due to the need to lease vehicular equipment, such as trucks, buses, forklifts etc. to cover unavailability and/or insufficient vehicular equipment of this type in the UNTAC vehicle establishment.
Provision had been made for the purchase of 750 minibuses for the period from 1 November 1992 to 30 April 1993 in addition to the requirement of 100 minibuses for the period ending on 31 October 1992.
The circumstances leading to the acquisition and utilization of those vehicles are explained in annex XLI.
Details relating to the proposed and current vehicle establishment as at 30 April 1993 are shown in annex XII. 6. Air operations
(a) Helicopters . (11 469 700)
Over-expenditures amounting to $11,469,700 under this heading were incurred as a result of an increase in the number of helicopters operating in the mission area and an increase in the number of hours flown ($9,185,300) and the consequent increase in fuel consumption ($2,284,400).
Regarding the size of the fleet it was necessary to supplement UNTAC-chartered aircraft by four to six MI-26 helicopters for various periods, and six Bell-212 and six Bell-206 helicopters.
The additional requirements and the increased number of flying hours were due to the need to support the registration process by moving personnel and supplies to effect the redeployment of the military battalions from cantonment sites to provincial capitals, districts and other locations, the greater reliance on air transport rather than road movements on account of the security situation and, finally, the inadequacy of runways capable of handling medium and heavy weight fixed-wing aircraft.
Furthermore, under the original implementation plan, the military contingents were to be deployed to regroupment and cantonment sites.
Because of the security situation and the refusal of one of the parties to participate in the cantonment and demobilization process, it was necessary to readjust the deployment of the military component so as to ensure the security of the electoral process.
As a result, air operations increased.
The resulting changes in fleet aircraft composition, a summary of hours flown and overflown, and utilization during the six-month period from 1 November 1992 to 30 April 1993 are shown in annexes XIII, XIV and XV.
(b) Fixed-wing aircraft . 906 200
Savings under hire/charter costs for fixed-wing aircraft amounting to $2,208,900 were partially offset by additional requirements of $1,302,700 for aviation fuel and lubricants.
(c) Air crew subsistence allowance . 766 900
Savings under air crew subsistence allowance were a result of delays in forward positioning of aircraft in airfields outside Phnom Penh until air traffic services at such airfields were in place.
(d) Other air operations costs . 9 659 200
Savings totalling $10,612,100 on air traffic control services and equipment ($10,456,400), fuel storage container ($150,000) and liability insurance ($5,700) were partially offset by additional requirements amounting to $952,900 under landing fees and ground handling.
Initial estimates for air traffic control and airfield services were to upgrade five airfields in Cambodia.
Cost savings were realized by concentrating air assets at three airfields only.
This reduced overall equipment requirements.
In addition, used fire and rescue vehicles were purchased.
These provided savings of $6,135,700.
Furthermore, in lieu of expensive commercial services, air traffic controller and fire and rescue personnel were provided by a contributing Government on a contingent basis.
These factors accounted for savings of some $4,320,615.
7. Naval operations . 9 014 900
Savings under this heading resulted from limited repairs to vessels, partly because of unavailability of spare parts, and rental of boats rather than purchase. 8. Communications
(a) Complementary communication . 791 900
Savings totalling $2,677,900 for communications equipment ($1,885,000) and workshop and test equipment ($792,900) were partially offset by additional requirements totalling $1,886,000 for spare parts and supplies ($555,300) and commercial communications ($1,330,700).
Additional requirements under commercial communications were due to the heavy volume of communications between Headquarters and Phnom Penh during the registration and election campaign periods.
(b) Main trunking contract . 150 800
Savings were due to lower than estimated labour-related and maintenance costs.
The expenditure incurred under this heading reflects the purchase and installation of a more capable commercial communications system, as proposed in an earlier report of the Secretary-General on the financing of UNAMIC and UNTAC (A/46/903).
It should be recalled that in its report of 10 December 1992 (A/47/763, para. 35), the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions requested the Secretary-General to re-examine that proposal with a view to finding out whether the commercially supplemented Military Communications System (Part A of the UNTAC communications network) could further be enhanced to achieve the needs of the mission in lieu of installing a massive commercial system (Part B of the UNTAC communications network).
Part A of the system provided mainly high-frequency voice radio communications and low-speed hard-copy teleprinter messages, and was equipped to cover only nine military sector headquarters.
It provided telephonic communication between Phnom Penh and two military sector headquarters with links passing through one provincial capital, but provided no facsimile facilities.
The use of terrestrial communications systems was severely restricted owing to the need to install repeaters along the communication routes.
The significant land-mine threat and the problem of providing security to remote repeaters precluded their extensive use.
A readily available but very low capacity telephone system utilizing the International Maritime Satellite network and commercial telephone equipment was also provided to all nine military sector headquarters.
Any attempt to enhance Part A, to achieve the objectives of the UNTAC operation, would have meant doubling the number of military communications personnel.
The quantity of military communications equipment which would have had to be deployed to achieve country-wide communications would have been beyond the capability of the total inventory of the current contributing country.
Combining the military communications capability of two or more countries was not a viable option because of the technical incompatibility of different national systems.
The resultant interoperability and interface problems could not have been solved without large-scale duplication of assets, repair and maintenance facilities and personnel.
In addition, it would not have been possible, using military equipment, to provide the capacity, data capability or level of service that has been provided to the mission by the Part B system.
To achieve those objectives with the Part A system would have required the provision of considerable amounts of non-military communications equipment; again there would have been very significant equipment interface problems to overcome because of the difference in technical capability of military versus non-military equipment.
A post facto comparison of Part A to Part B has shown that Part A would have been quite inadequate to support the electoral process in Cambodia.
In effect, the Military Communications System (Part A) provided a "quick-fix" communications solution that quickly exhausted its ability to cope with the rapid expansion and deployment of the mission.
Enhancing Part A would have meant patching up a system to cope with the requirements of an unusually large and logistically complex mission.
9. Other equipment . 658 300
Savings totalling $3,183,600 under office equipment ($813,400), petrol tank plus metering equipment ($681,500), medical equipment ($51,800) and parts and repair of equipment ($1,636,900) were partially offset by additional requirements totalling $2,525,300 under office furniture ($154,500), observation equipment ($237,400), data-processing equipment ($147,800), generators ($802,400) and miscellaneous equipment ($1,183,200).
Additional generators (1 kVA) were required to support the electoral teams travelling on foot in remote areas.
Additional requirements under observation equipment were due to the need to acquire high-cost infrared night vision devices as a result of attacks on UNTAC facilities and personnel which occurred mostly after dark.
Over-expenditure of $1,183,200 under miscellaneous equipment was due to the acquisition of additional equipment such as wheel locks, Maglights, sirens, revolving lights etc. to strengthen the security and safety of all mission personnel. 10. Supplies and services
(a) Miscellaneous services . (1 638 600)
Additional requirements totalling $2,558,300 under contractual services ($1,399,400), maintenance services ($647,400), miscellaneous other services ($497,100) and official hospitality ($14,400) were partly offset by savings of $919,700 under security services ($140,900), medical treatment and services ($277,200) and claims and adjustments ($501,600).
(b) Miscellaneous supplies . (7 853 200)
Additional requirements totalling $8,223,400 under stationery and office supplies ($123,100), medical supplies ($3,120,100), sanitation and cleaning materials ($321,700), subscriptions ($5,800), uniform items, flags and decals ($2,634,700), field defence stores ($594,200), quartermaster and general stores ($734,800) and miscellaneous supplies ($689,000) were partly offset by savings of $370,200 under ballistic protective blankets for vehicles ($348,800) and operational maps ($21,400).
Over-expenditure of $3,120,100 in medical supplies was due essentially to the decision not to reduce the military component after 31 October 1992.
The retention of contingents throughout the reporting period and the resulting rotations created additional requirements for vaccines.
Requirements for additional uniforms have increased because of troop rotation.
Moreover, the acquisition of additional flak jackets was required.
11. Election-related supplies and services . 1 243 000
Savings totalling $1,335,300 for various election materials ($978,400) and election-related contractual services ($356,900) were partially offset by the over-expenditure of $92,300 under standard kits for registration teams.
12. Public information programmes . (986 200)
Savings of $2,015,300 under contractual services were partly offset by additional requirements of $3,001,500 for materials and supplies ($538,000) and equipment ($2,463,500).
The over-expenditure in equipment is due to the purchase of a turnkey radio broadcast station and a television studio at costs higher than originally envisaged.
Provision had been made for contractual services in support of information programmes consisting of staff for the new studio complex to increase production and to run Radio UNTAC.
It was originally estimated that the hiring of a staff of 30 persons would be at an all-inclusive cost of $100,000 per person for the duration of the mission.
Instead, UNTAC opted to hire 12 international staff on special service agreements at a cost of $150,000 per person for three months, which resulted in savings under contractual services.
13. Training programmes . 290 900
The requirements under this heading were lower than estimated.
14. Mine-clearing programmes . 1 777 500
Savings of $2,412,000 under supplies, services and operating costs were partly offset by additional requirements amounting to $634,500 under mine-clearing equipment.
15. Assistance to factions . 3 149 300
Savings were due to the fact that the cantonment process did not materialize to the extent envisaged under the Paris Accords.
16. Air and surface freight . (7 899 600)
Additional resources were required for military airlift ($8,573,400) and commercial freight and cartage ($252,100).
These over-expenditures were partly offset by savings under transport of contingent-owned equipment ($925,900).
17. Support account for peace-keeping operations . -
The amount authorized has been transferred to the support account for peace-keeping operations.
18. Integrated Management Information System . -
There was no change under this item.
19. Staff assessment . 3 309 100
Savings resulted from the delayed deployment of local staff in the mission area.
20. Income from staff assessment. (3 309 100)
This item is based on item 19 above.
ANNEX IV
Expenditure for the period from 1 November 1991 to 30 April 1993,
revised cost estimates for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993
and cost estimates for the period from 1 to 31 August 1993:
supplementary information
A. Cost parameters
The estimates set out herein were calculated, where applicable, on the basis of the cost parameters indicated below.
1. Mission subsistence allowance
Budgetary provision is made for the payment of subsistence allowance to both military and international civilian staff.
The subsistence rate used throughout these cost estimates is $130 per person per day.
2. Military observers, mine-clearing personnel and
naval observers
Mission subsistence allowance to military observers, mine-clearing personnel and naval observers is provided for.
Clothing and equipment allowance is based on the rate of $200 per person per annum, and travel to and from the mission area is provided for.
No reimbursement is provided to Governments for national salaries and allowances.
3. Other military personnel
Reimbursement to Governments is based on the existing standard rates, set by the General Assembly in resolution 45/258 of 3 May 1991 at $988 per person per month for basic pay, all ranks; an additional $291 per person per month for a limited number of specialists; and $70 per person per month for usage factor in respect of personal clothing, gear and equipment, including $5 per person per month for personal weaponry and ammunition.
4. Civilian personnel costs
Salaries and staff costs of international staff are net of staff assessment and are based on standard rates for New York for staff in the Professional category and above and the General Service category; and Field Operations standard rates for staff in the Field Service category.
Salaries for locally recruited staff are based on the scale currently in effect for Phnom Penh, although that scale is being considered for upward revision.
For reasons of administrative simplicity and equality of treatment, a uniform rate had been established for all areas in Cambodia, both for staff deployed in Phnom Penh and those assigned to duty stations outside Phnom Penh who would have been exposed to greater hardship and hazardous conditions.
Civilian police are paid a mission subsistence and clothing allowance at the rates and conditions specified in paragraph 3 above.
No reimbursement is provided to Governments for national salaries and allowances.
B. Security enhancement
In view of the deterioration in the security situation in Cambodia, the need to have available additional means of transport to support the elections and, if need be, the hurried evacuation of personnel from locations in imminent danger of attack or actually under attack, military helicopters and crews were seen as a requirement.
After urgent consultations held by the Secretary-General with a number of Governments, the Governments of Australia, Malaysia and Singapore provided helicopters.
The helicopter crews provided by those States were treated as a formed contingent; reimbursements for troop costs will therefore be made to those Governments based on average troop strength.
Details of the deployment are as follows:
They were provided on the basis of $1,934 per hour for 100 flying hours per aircraft per month, less fuel and crew costs.
The initial period of provision is four to six weeks;
(b) Malaysia: eight S-61 Nuri helicopters arrived in UNTAC and were deployed to operate from Kompong Chhang West on 15 May 1993.
They were provided on the basis of $780 per hour for 75 flying hours per aircraft per month, less fuel and crew costs.
Initial provision was for a one-month period, until 15 June 1993, with possible extension to 31 July 1993 and beyond;
(c) Singapore: four AS-332 Super Puma helicopters arrived in UNTAC and were deployed to operate from Stung Treng on 24 May 1993.
They were provided on the basis of $5,133.75 per hour for 75 flying hours per aircraft per month, less fuel and crew costs.
The aircraft were provided for one month.
Other equipment was provided as follows:
(a) Indonesia provided eight V-150 armoured personnel carriers, 1 recovery vehicle and 47 personnel;
(b) Namibia provided 15 mine-protected vehicles (Wolf), each with a three-man crew, technical/maintenance support, command control and communications group.
Emergency operational supplies were provided by the United States of America under the Letters of Assist arrangements as follows: flak jackets, litters, shell/wound dressings, smoke pots, gloves, bullet-proof jackets (body armour), helmets (United States pattern infantryman), illumination flares (parachute type), flare pots (illuminating and coloured smoke).
The United States of America also provided three heavy transport aircraft (C-5) sorties required to deploy the Australian Air Unit; five C-5 sorties required to deploy 15 Namibian mine-protected vehicles, including the contingent and airlift support to deploy five Indonesian armoured personnel carriers, including the military personnel.
All equipment, services and supplies have been provided by the Governments on a reimbursable basis.
Provision is therefore made for costs associated with the security enhancement of UNTAC under the appropriate budget line item.
C. Requirements
(a) Military observers The estimates provide for 479 military observers, 214 naval observers and 200 mine-clearing and training personnel for 77,539 person-days for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993; and for 476 military observers, 214 naval observers and 160 mine-clearing and training personnel for 25,462 person-days for the month of August 1993.
The estimates are based on the phasing-out schedule of military observers shown in annex XVI.

ANNEX VIII
Proposals for the disposition of assets
Introduction
Under its current mandate, UNTAC will have to start phasing out at the end of August 1993.
The range of United Nations assets to be disposed of, valued at several hundred million United States dollars, is unprecedented for a United Nations peace-keeping operation.
In view of the time required for planning, the Secretary-General believes that it is appropriate to outline the principles he proposes to follow in the disposition of United Nations-owned equipment, supplies and other goods of UNTAC and to seek guidance from the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions on the appropriate method of disposing of some of the assets of UNTAC.
In making his recommendation to the Committee, the Secretary-General has considered the factors set out below.
Needs of other missions
In one instance in the past, a considerable amount of assets were handed over to the new Government after the end of the mission.
At that time, however, there were only a few United Nations peace-keeping or other missions and no new ones were on the horizon.
At present, there is likelihood for United Nations involvement, requiring those assets, in many countries around the world, in addition to the continuing needs of other ongoing missions, such as UNPROFOR, ONUMOZ and UNOSOM.
There is also a continuing need to replace various items of equipment in long-established missions.
Moreover, the delays that UNTAC has experienced in procuring, receiving and installing equipment have often hampered the smooth operation of the mission.
Rehabilitation needs of Cambodia
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which has the primary responsibility for the rehabilitation and development of Cambodia, recommended to the Secretary-General that the disposal of UNTAC assets, to an appropriate extent, should address and take into account the current and longer-term development needs of Cambodia.
Since UNDP has access to appropriate technical and managerial expertise, either through its ongoing projects within the country or through other sources available at its disposal, UNDP would participate in the determination of an appropriate course of action to be pursued for the disposal of UNTAC assets.
To that effect, close coordination has been established between UNTAC and UNDP.
The latter is now represented in the Asset Disposal Committee established by UNTAC to oversee the disposition of its assets.
Other factors for consideration
Other important considerations that should be taken into account in determining which option to follow in disposing of the assets are:
(a) Current and/or acquirable absorption capacity of the new Government of Cambodia, in terms of operation and maintenance, and financial sustainability;
(b) Implementation capacity of United Nations organizations and international and non-governmental organizations;
(c) Cost-benefit of leaving equipment behind as opposed to its withdrawal, taking into account the options of selling or donating.
Recommendations of the Secretary-General
Taking the above factors into consideration, the Secretary-General proposes that UNTAC property be disposed of during the liquidation phase in the following manner:
(a) Equipment which conforms to established standards or is considered compatible with existing equipment would be re-deployed to other United Nations operations elsewhere in the world or placed in reserve for use by future missions;
(b) Certain United Nations agencies and international and non-governmental organizations are operating in Cambodia or are in the process of establishing a presence there.
It is anticipated that that presence will gradually increase in order to facilitate the provision of material and technical support to the Cambodian people.
Equipment that may be required for the start-up or expansion of those organizations' operations, and that cannot be kept in reserve in terms of subparagraph (a) above, would be transferred to a relevant agency against appropriate credit to the UNTAC Special Account;
(c) Commercial disposal under standard United Nations procedures within the country;
(d) Any surplus UNTAC assets remaining after disposition of the items referred to in subparagraphs (a) to (c) above and/or any assets already installed in Cambodia, the dismantling of which would in fact set back the rehabilitation progress of the country, would be contributed to the duly recognized Government of Cambodia.
This refers, in particular, to airfield installation and equipment, bridges and mine-clearing equipment.
Classification of assets
UNDP has recently recruited a logistician whose task will be to provide a realistic assessment of the development needs of Cambodia.
Pending the outcome of that study, UNTAC has already started the process of collecting, analysing and evaluating inputs from the various units within UNTAC responsible for the operation and maintenance of specific kinds of equipment.
A preliminary review of all properties held by UNTAC has now been completed; the inventory value is approximately $208.4 million, excluding transportation and installation costs.
A summary table of the assets potentially available by 1 August 1993 is shown in appendix I. The categories of assets listed in the summary table have been provisionally classified into three groups.
A brief explanation for each category follows the table.
Group I includes assets identified as meeting the requirements of other United Nations missions.
It is recommended that items in this group, valued at approximately $57.47 million, be transferred to storage warehouses in three different locations in Cambodia for potential use by other United Nations missions.
Group II consists of assets identified by cost-benefit analysis, as not suitable for transfer outside Cambodia.
They include those assets which, because of their physical condition, are not worth the additional costs of transfer outside Cambodia and those whose physical location prohibits removal.
It is therefore recommended that the assets listed in Group II remain in Cambodia.
The UNTAC Asset Disposal Committee will make further recommendations for their final disposition.
The total residual value of Group II amounts to $59.4 million.
The remainder of the assets, which have a residual value of approximately $33.36 million, have not yet been classified into Group I or Group II. The UNTAC Asset Disposal Committee will study further and make recommendations for their final disposition.
It is foreseen that some of them could be utilized by other United Nations missions.
Those assets are summarized under Group III.
In order to arrive at the residual value indicated in the table, UNTAC had developed depreciation scales to be applied against the property or assets at the time of eventual disposition.
The depreciation scales are presented in appendix II.
Conclusion
From the foregoing, it is clear that a more detailed study of the issue will be required and, as a result, some flexibility in the allocation of assets among the three groups will have to be applied.
The disposal of assets will be a continuing process, and options should be kept open until the end of the liquidation phase.
At the present stage, the Secretary-General seeks the approval of the General Assembly, in principle, to proceed along the lines described above.
Details of the final disposition will be reported in the performance report to be submitted to the Assembly at its forty-eighth session in accordance with paragraph 12 of Assembly resolution 47/209 of 22 December 1992.

The disposal of the vehicular equipment is as follows:
Group I. Vehicles to be transferred to other United Nations missions ($11.13 million)
(a) 500 vehicles at an average cost of $12,300 to be stored in the mission area for transfer to other United Nations missions, with a residual value of $6.15 million;
(b) 463 vehicles requested for transfer to UNOSOM, with a residual value of $4.98 million.
(a) Older vehicles with a remaining life, valued at $1.08 million;
(b) Vehicles situated in remote areas which could only be removed by helicopter, so that retrieval is not economical, valued at $3.47 million;
(c) Vehicles damaged by accident beyond economical repair, valued at $0.69 million;
(d) Vehicles missing or seized, valued at $0.41 million;
(e) It is anticipated that, because of severe road conditions in Cambodia, 3 per cent of the remaining vehicular fleet, upon collection from all over Cambodia, will be in a condition that makes repair uneconomical.
This represents 155 vehicles with an average cost of $6,750, together valued at $1.05 million.
All vehicles indicated above can be disposed of locally either by sale or transfer to other United Nations activities in the area (UNDP, UNHCR, UNICEF etc.) or donated to the new Government of Cambodia.
The disposal of the balance of the vehicles will be decided on the recommendation of the Asset Disposal Committee.
Prefabricated buildings with a total value of approximately $11 million have already been transferred from UNTAC to the mission in Somalia.
The total value of prefabricated accommodation in Cambodia, excluding the installation and transportation costs, is estimated at approximately $45.11 million.
The non-recoverable international and in-country transportation costs, site preparation and erection costs are estimated to be approximately $31 million.
The non-recoverable costs would be taken into account in the event of sale.
A construction consultant visited Cambodia in April/May 1993 and travelled to various provinces to evaluate the feasibility of dismantling and repacking the prefabricated accommodation.
He concluded that it would be neither practical nor cost-efficient to dismantle the "hardwall" prefabricated accommodation installed in Cambodia but that it would be possible to recover some of the "softwall" prefabricated accommodation.
He recommended that the current condition of the softwall accommodation should first be evaluated; subject to a positive finding, an evaluation should be made of the potential condition of the softwall accommodation after re-installation in another place.
If either evaluation should be negative as to cost-efficiency, the softwall accommodation in question is to be left in the country.
There is a certain amount of accommodation, at a value of approximately $19.19 million, which it is considered cost-efficient to move and for which little or no use is anticipated after the election.
This includes the camps transferred to Somalia and the 66 eight-man camps which have not yet been erected.
Those camps, with an approximate value of $14.7 million, will not be subject to depreciation.
It is recommended that this category of prefabricated accommodation be transferred to a storage warehouse or to another mission as required.
The prefabricated units are broken down as follows:
Type of prefabricated unit
Used
A factor of 14.29 per cent was applied to equipment for the first year of life, which is based on an average life expectancy of seven years, as outlined in the life cycle cost report.
Equipment more than one year old was depreciated at a rate of 24.49 per cent.
A breakdown of the calculation is as follows:
Type of equipment
Less than 1 year
Over 1 year
The trunking network is a collection of independent modular technologies which can be broken down into modular parts and transferred to other missions.
Alternatively, the network may be offered for sale "as is where is" through closed bids.
The network was installed at a cost of $33.98 million, comprising $17.48 million in direct equipment expenditures and $16.5 million in expenses.
If the option of transfer and/or sale by module for export is considered, the United Nations will probably realize the depreciated value of the equipment, namely, $14.98 million, but it will need to incur the additional costs of expert dismantling, estimated at $1.2 million.
On the other hand, if the network were to be sold in Cambodia, it is to be expected that part of the installation expenses could be recovered.
To ensure efficient dissemination of neutral information in support of the electoral process, it was deemed best for UNTAC to have its own radio broadcasting facilities.
There are currently at least four radio stations in Cambodia but only two of them are nationwide.
The equipment could be disposed of either through sale or transfer to other United Nations offices/missions, especially newer studio equipment valued at $0.58 million, with a depreciated value of $0.5 million.
Generators have been depreciated according to the following scale: (a) new generators, 10 per cent depreciation; (b) deployed generators, 10 per cent depreciation; and (c) 5 kVA and below, 20 per cent depreciation.
Generators have been categorized on the basis of their depreciated value, cost of removal, condition and security of location, logistics of removal (i.e., use of truck, road availability, crane, helicopter), type of generator and actual physical condition.
The categories have been allocated to the three groups as follows:
Group I To be transferred to other missions ($6.53 million)
(a) Fully enclosed generators needing special shed construction;
(b) Modified integrated generator systems;
(c) Generators with low running hours.
Group II To be left in Cambodia ($4.59 million)
(a) Generators whose depreciated value is much less than the cost of logistics for removal;
(b) Generators whose physical location would be so remote as not to warrant retrieval;
(c) Where security conditions will not permit;
(d) Generators installed in premises provided free of charge by existing administrative structures.
Detailed figures are as follows:
Type of generator dollars)
New 1.95 1.76
Deployed 6.80 6.12
Air support equipment consists of mobile control towers, airfield lighting sets and fire rescue vehicles.
All the rest of the equipment is very much needed in the country.
Navigational aids have been specifically designed for Cambodia and will cost as much to remove and reprogram at the factory for other missions as they are worth.
The precision path indicators and runway and approach lighting sets are essential to provide all-weather day and night capable airfields.
These items are essential until UNTAC is fully withdrawn; they have been permanently installed to avoid theft and cannot be removed.
Refurbished foam fire and rescue vehicles over 12 years old should remain as there is only one water fire tender to serve all the airfields in the country.
The total value of these items under Group II is $1.34 million.
The alternatives appear as follows:
Naval aids and lighting sets
Nearly all equipment could be put into storage or transferred to other missions.
However, in the event that an organization such as UNESCO or UNDP has a plan for the rehabilitation of the country by creating a centre for computing and training, part of the equipment could be earmarked for that purpose.
The electoral computer system was designed to use the Khmer language.
It consists of Khmer keyboards, monitors, three central processing units (CPUs) and four high-speed printers.
Owing to its design, the system is not useful outside Cambodia except for its proper CPUs and printers.
Therefore, a working subset of the system which has the Khmer system should be left in Cambodia.
The equipment for transfer under Group I has a value of $4.03 million and the equipment to be left in Cambodia under Group II a value of $1.8 million.
The division of major types of items is as follows:
Electoral server and peripherals
Personal computers with monitors, printers, scanners, uninterrupted power supply, plotters
Software
Network items, computer access
The furniture and fixtures are used in various degrees, therefore the average depreciation is estimated at 30 per cent.
Therefore, and in view of the bulkiness of the equipment, the suggested method of disposal is disposal in the country.
Group I includes those machines which are new and transferable to other missions.
Group II are those machines in poor condition, which were used for a heavy volume of photocopying, often 8 to 10 hours a day, 7 days per week.
Copy count on those machines is high, sometimes almost three times the average, based on specifications; wear is extensive and reconditioning will be costly.
Given the depreciated value and the cost of reconditioning, added to freight expenses, it is uneconomical to send those machines to any other mission.
Group III includes those machines which are in good to acceptable condition, for which wear is low to moderate and the cost of reconditioning is minimal to moderate.
Transfer to other missions or storage is to be decided by the Asset Disposal Committee.
Facsimile machines are fairly new items enjoying favourable operating environments.
The wear and tear on them is low and all can be transferred to other missions.
10. Upgrading of government buildings UNTAC invested $0.45 million to renovate existing government structures throughout the provinces and many districts of Cambodia.
Those upgraded facilities will be returned to the Cambodian authorities, possibly inclusive of generators and air-conditioners.
Military installations include costs of labour and materials used to upgrade military camps which cannot be removed.
Approximately $4.8 million has been spent to construct accommodation for the 15,000 military personnel throughout the provinces of Cambodia.
The structures include barracks, toilets, kitchens, maintenance facilities and other support structures that were not available in the numerous remote sites.
Those facilities were constructed mostly by self-help with local labour and, in some cases, with contractors using local labour.
The wooden structures are rudimentary in design and cannot be removed, and should therefore be turned over to local officials.
Some 1,500 metres of bridge material was purchased and only 750 m was installed. It is strongly recommended that the installed part be left in Cambodia.
Disposal of the 750 m of uninstalled Bailey bridge is to be decided on by the Asset Disposal Committee.
13. Water purification and bladders The water purification plants and associated storage bladders should be retrieved from military units as they close out their mission in Cambodia and stored locally for use by other United Nations organizations.
A small quantity of panellized fibreglass tanks and 500-gallon air transportable bladders should be recovered and transferred to other missions.
Underground submersible well pumps (up to 84 in quantity) which cannot be maintained locally may also be recovered for possible use by other missions.
Those pumps are capable of pumping water to a height of 75 m at the rate of 2,400 litres per hour.
Approximately $300,000 could be transferred to other missions.
The containers, totalling 387 units of 20 containers and 2 units of 40 containers, at a value of $0.65 million and a depreciated value of $0.45 million, may be useful during the liquidation of the mission for transporting United Nations property from the various provinces to the three designated storage locations.
They can also be used for shipment overseas and temporary shelter or storage of items which are not immediately required.
The three armoured mine-clearing bulldozers, at a value of $1.25 million, were purchased to assist the mine-clearing effort.
They have not proved suitable for the type of terrain and vegetation encountered in Cambodia.
Their depreciated value is $0.96 million.
They should be transferred to other missions, and used for other purposes than mine-clearing unless the terrain is favourable to mechanical mine-clearing.
Detailed figures are as follows:
Miscellaneous Mine-clearing bulldozers
Miscellaneous equipment includes air-conditioners, radar, binoculars and high-vision equipment (subject to export licence), protective vests, ballistic blankets, hand-held metal detectors, some of the zodiac boats, cameras, identification kits, and other equipment which could be moved to storage or transferred to other missions.
APPENDIX II
Depreciation percentage applied to the different categories of UNTAC assets
The life expectancy of vehicles is as follows:
(a) Category I
Light vehicles: Sedans, light and medium Jeeps, light trucks and minibuses
Life expectancy: 5 years or 120,000 km, whichever comes first
Percentage 25 per cent first and second year distribution: 20 per cent third year 15 per cent fourth and fifth year, applied over five years pro rata temporis per month
(b) Category II
Medium vehicles: Ambulances, medium buses and trucks up to 4 tons
Life expectancy: 8 years or 135,000 km, whichever comes first
Percentage 20 per cent first year distribution: 15 per cent second and third year 10 per cent fourth to eighth year, applied over eight years pro rata temporis per month
(c) Category III
Heavy vehicles: Heavy buses and trucks over 4 tons
Life expectancy: 10 years or 250,000 km, whichever comes first
Percentage 15 per cent first year distribution: 10 per cent second to ninth year 5 per cent tenth year, 10 years pro rata temporis per month
The applicable percentages are calculated with reference to the remainder value, i.e., for Category I, 25 per cent of the original value the first year, 25 per cent of the remaining value the second year, and so on.
Consequently, there will always be a residual value.
The majority of the 5,736 UNTAC vehicles were received in new condition, even though some of them were manufactured in 1991.
Therefore, the year of receipt, 1992, was used as the basis for applying the scales of depreciation described above, and vehicles manufactured in 1991 or 1992 were depreciated from the date they were placed in service.
Vehicles received from the other missions were depreciated on the basis of their residual value at the time of receipt.
Because of factors like varying designs, methods of construction, various degrees of wear and tear and even damage from shrapnel and rocket-propelled grenades, depreciation rates applied for prefabricated units ranged between 40 and 85 per cent.
For the purpose of this exercise, a weighted average depreciation rate of 50 per cent was used to cover all categories of prefabricated units.
No depreciation factor was applied to units transferred to Somalia, because they were unused (ATCO camps, valued at $11 million) and to a number of non-erected eight-man camps (34 BMS and 32 AUSCO, valued at $3.7 million).
The following depreciation factors were used for complementary, trunking and broadcast equipment with a recovery period of seven years: (a) equipment less than one-year old: 14.29 per cent; (b) equipment over one-year old: 24.49 per cent.
Equipment received from other missions was depreciated on the basis of residual value at the time of receipt, but with a life expectancy of seven years.
Generators were depreciated according to the following categories:
(a) New generators - 10 per cent depreciation.
These generators are new and still packaged.
Their usefulness declines however with storage, because of dried seals etc., and a 10 per cent depreciation rate was therefore applied;
(b) Deployed generators - 10 per cent depreciation.
These generators, although deployed, are heavy-duty and regularly maintained and serviced with new replaceable spare parts that extend their useful lifespan.
Regularly maintained generators are more useful than stored ones, and therefore a 10 per cent depreciation rate was also applied to this category of equipment;
(c) 5-kVA and below - 20 per cent depreciation.
These machines are light-duty equipment with a short lifespan, and the cost of repair is high compared to their acquisition cost.
As opposed to the larger generators, they are portable and suffer more damage.
A 20 per cent depreciation rate was therefore applied.
Air support equipment consists of: (a) mobile control towers, navigational aids and airfield lighting sets, which were depreciated by 10 per cent; and (b) six locally purchased fire and rescue vehicles, which were depreciated according to the scale applied to vehicles, which is 7.5 per cent. 6. Electronic data-processing equipment
Different rates were applied depending on the type of equipment:
(a) Accessory equipment and software.
For this category, a 30 per cent depreciation rate was applied.
(b) Equipment slowly outdated.
This category, including computer equipment which is slowly outdated by the computer market, was depreciated by 40 per cent.
It comprises primarily plotters, uninterrupted power supply units and voltage regulators;
(c) Equipment quickly outdated.
This category includes computer equipment which becomes quickly obsolete as new equipment is produced and improved every year.
It comprises desktop and laptop computers, monitors and scanners.
Used equipment is rendered outdated immediately and was depreciated by 50 per cent.
For unused equipment, a depreciation rate of 30 per cent was applied.
As the furniture and fixtures are used in various degrees, an average depreciation rate of 30 per cent was applied.
Photocopiers and facsimile machines were depreciated according to the following scales:
(a) Scale 0 - No depreciation.
These items are new or unused;
(b) Scale 1 - 10 per cent depreciation.
These items, received in 1992, are not yet one-year old but are being used continuously;
(c) Scale 2 - 20 per cent depreciation.
These items are over one-year old;
(d) Scale 3 - 60 per cent depreciation.
These are used items received from various United Nations missions.
10. Other equipment
The following depreciation rates were applied to categories 10 to 14 and 16:
(a) Upgrading of government buildings - 10 per cent
(b) Military installations - 50 per cent
(c) Bridges - 10 per cent
(e) Containers - 30 per cent
(f) Miscellaneous - 30 per cent
This equipment consists of mine detectors which were depreciated by 30 per cent and miscellaneous equipment and mine-clearing bulldozers, to which a 25 per cent depreciation rate was applied.
ANNEX XLI
Procurement of 850 minibuses
Background information
The prime objective of the UNTAC mission is to hold fair and free elections in Cambodia.
It had been established that 850 minibuses and 500 4x4 vehicles would be required during the elections to transport registered voters to and from the polling stations.
Experience has shown that, in the acquisition of vehicles, a lead time of many months is required from the time of requisition until delivery can be expected.
Even so, the indicated delivery time is often postponed.
In the light of these considerations, requisitions were raised for the acquisition of 850 minibuses and 2,100 4x4 vehicles, of which 500 were to be used for the election process.
Those requisitions were issued as a matter of efficient routine, in the knowledge that a final purchase order could not be issued for several months.
Subsequent to the raising of the requisitions and the commencement of the market research for vehicles, the Director of Administration of UNTAC indicated in cables to the Field Operations Division that the final purchase orders should not be placed until he was able to review the situation further, taking specific advantage of experience that could be gained during the registration period.
This did not mean that the procurement process as such, i.e., the search for the lowest acceptable bid, should cease.
Owing to a communication misunderstanding, the staff at Headquarters interpreted a message from the field as a confirmation of the need for vehicles and purchase orders were issued.
This error was discovered only on 28 September 1992 and requests were issued to keep the orders for 500 4x4 vehicles and 850 minibuses in abeyance.
The case was immediately drawn to the attention of the Assistant Secretary-General for General Services, who at that time was responsible for the Field Operations Division, and the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management.
Other top officials were also informed.
The Director of Field Operations was requested to take the following action:
(a) To ensure that as little unnecessary expense as possible was incurred by the Organization;
(b) To investigate whether any impropriety or intentional fault had been committed;
(c) To ensure the non-recurrence of similar mistakes.
With regard to (a) above, the Director of Field Operations, together with the Chief of the Commercial Purchase and Transport Section, appealed to the two vendors concerned to postpone the relevant purchase order. While the company chosen to supply the 4x4s complied to the United Nations request, the vendor of the minibuses stubbornly refused to cooperate under a number of pretexts, which the United Nations did not accept.
As to (b) above, a consultant to the Secretary-General carried out an investigation and established that no improprieties had taken place.
However, in view of the history of the case, it would have been more appropriate to reconfirm the need for those vehicles with the UNTAC Director of Administration prior to the issuance of the purchase order.
8. As to (c) above, the Director of Field Operations issued new written instructions as to procedures to be followed, with copies specifically to individuals releasing purchase orders to the Commercial Purchase and Transport Section.
9. It should be noted that the minibuses were obtained at an extremely favourable price, far below the prevailing market price.
In addition, the exchange rate of the United States dollar to the Japanese yen has dropped some 20 per cent.
Thus, the vehicles now available to the United Nations, and to various missions where they are needed, are by chance at an even more favourable price.

III. RECOMMENDATION OF THE FIFTH COMMITTEE
6. The Fifth Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the following draft resolution:
Financing of the United Nations Operation in Somalia
The General Assembly,
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the initial phase of the expanded size and mandate of the United Nations Operation in Somalia A/47/916/Add.1. and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, A/47/984.
Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 751 (1992) of 24 April 1992, by which the Council established the United Nations Operation in Somalia,

I. INTRODUCTION
By its resolution 693 (1991) of 20 May 1991, the Security Council established, under its authority, a United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) to monitor all agreements concluded between the Government of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional (FMLN) for an initial period of 12 months beginning on 1 July 1991.
The Council decided that the initial mandate of the Observer Mission, in its first phase as an integrated peace-keeping operation, would be to verify the compliance by the parties with the Agreement on Human Rights signed at San José on 26 July 1990 (A/44/971-S/21541, annex), and that the subsequent tasks or phases of the Observer Mission would be subject to the approval of the Council.
By its resolution 45/267 of 21 June 1991, the General Assembly appropriated $13.8 million gross ($13 million net) for the operation of ONUSAL for the period from 1 July to 31 December 1991.
In addition, the Assembly authorized the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for ONUSAL in an amount not to exceed $9.2 million gross ($8.8 million net), with the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1992, inclusive.
The above amounts were to be apportioned among Member States in accordance with the scheme set out in the resolution.
In a report to the Security Council on 10 January 1992 (S/23402), the Secretary-General informed the Council that as a result of the signing of the Act of New York on 31 December 1991, the Government of El Salvador and FMLN had concluded a number of further agreements which, following a final round of negotiations on two outstanding issues, would be signed at Mexico City on 16 January 1992.
Subject to the approval of the Council, two of those agreements would require an immediate and substantial increase in the strength of ONUSAL if it was to assume the verification and monitoring functions desired of it by the two parties.
One was an agreement on the cessation of the armed confrontation, in which it was envisaged that ONUSAL would verify all aspects of the cease-fire and the separation of forces, and the other an agreement on the National Civil Police, in which it was envisaged that ONUSAL would monitor the maintenance of public order during a transitional period while a new National Civil Police was set up.
By its resolution 729 (1992) of 14 January 1992, the Security Council approved the above-mentioned report of the Secretary-General and decided to enlarge the mandate of ONUSAL to include the verification and monitoring of the implementation of all the agreements to be signed at Mexico City between the Government of El Salvador and FMLN.
The Council further extended the existing mandate of ONUSAL until 31 October 1992 and decided that the mandate would be reviewed at that time on the basis of recommendations to be presented by the Secretary-General.
By its resolution 46/240 of 22 May 1992, the General Assembly appropriated $39 million gross ($37 million net), inclusive of the $10 million authorized with the concurrence of the Advisory Committee, for the period from 1 January to 31 October 1992.
In addition, in paragraph 8 of that resolution, the Assembly decided that $2 million of the unencumbered balance of the appropriation should be retained in the special account and that the balance of $1,347,700 should be offset against the apportionment among Member States as provided for in paragraph 5 of the resolution.
Subsequently, the Security Council, by its resolution 784 (1992) of 30 October 1992, extended the mandate of ONUSAL for an interim period of one month, until 30 November 1992 and, by its resolution 791 (1992) of 30 November 1992, for a further period of six months, until 31 May 1993.
Owing to the lack of time to consider the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of ONUSAL (A/47/751), the Fifth Committee, at its 46th meeting, on 16 December 1992, decided to recommend to the General Assembly that, in order to provide for the continued maintenance of ONUSAL, it should authorize the Secretary-General to enter into commitments up to the amount of $8,045,600 gross ($7,514,200 net) for the period ending on 28 February 1993 and apportion that amount among Member States in accordance with the scheme set out in its resolution 47/41 of 1 December 1992.
The General Assembly, by its decision 47/452 of 22 December 1992, concurred with the recommendation of the Fifth Committee.
By its resolution 47/223 of 16 March 1993, the General Assembly appropriated an amount of $17.2 million gross ($16 million net) for the operation of ONUSAL for the period from 1 December 1992 to 31 May 1993.
This was inclusive of the amount of $8,045,600 gross ($7,514,200 net) authorized and apportioned in accordance with its decision 47/452.
The Assembly decided that $4.6 million of the combined miscellaneous and interest income in the special account should be credited to Member States against their assessed contributions for the period from 1 December 1992 to 31 May 1993.
The Assembly also decided that the remaining unencumbered balance of the United Nations Observer Group in Central America (ONUCA) should be credited to Member States against their assessed contributions for the next mandate period of ONUSAL, should the Security Council renew the mandate of ONUSAL beyond 31 May 1993, or should be credited to Member States against their assessed contributions for other United Nations peace-keeping operations, in accordance with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, in the event that the Council decided not to renew the mandate of ONUSAL beyond 31 May 1993.
In addition, the Assembly authorized the entering into commitments for the period beginning on 1 June 1993, should the Security Council decide to continue the Mission beyond 31 May 1993, at a rate not to exceed $2.9 million gross ($2.7 million net) per month, subject to obtaining the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.
The full amount of $17.2 million gross ($16 million net) has been apportioned at the present time and the authorization provided by the Assembly in its resolution 47/223 has not been utilized.
In a report to the Security Council (S/25812) of 21 May 1993, the Secretary-General recalled his letter dated 26 January 1993 to the Council (S/25241), wherein he had informed the Council that, on 8 January 1993, the Government of El Salvador had officially requested the United Nations to observe the general elections scheduled for March 1994, which would mark the culmination of the peace process.
The Secretary-General further indicated in his report that a technical mission had visited El Salvador from 18 to 28 April 1993.
The purpose of that mission was to define the terms of reference, concept of operations and financial implications of expanding the ONUSAL mandate to include the observation of the electoral process.
In the light of the considerations and observations presented in his report, the Secretary-General recommended to the Security Council that it renew until 30 November 1993 the mandate of ONUSAL, and that it authorize the addition of an Electoral Division to observe the elections.
The Secretary-General also informed the Council that he intended to recommend, by 30 November 1993, a further renewal of the mandate of ONUSAL to enable it to complete its verification of the elections and to remain in El Salvador for a short transition period immediately thereafter.
In an addendum to that report (S/25812/Add.1), the Secretary-General informed the Council that, should it decide to expand the mandate of ONUSAL as set out in the main part of his report, it was estimated that the additional cost of the expansion for the 11-month period from 1 June 1993 until 30 April 1994 would be approximately $7 million.
The Secretary-General also indicated that, should the Council decide to expand the mandate of ONUSAL, he would recommend to the General Assembly that that amount be considered an expense of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations.
In addition, the assessments to be levied on Member States should be credited to the ONUSAL special account.
By its resolution 832 (1993) of 27 May 1993 the Security Council approved the report of the Secretary-General (S/25812 and Add.1 and 2).
The Council also decided to enlarge the mandate of ONUSAL to include the observation of the electoral process due to conclude with the general elections in El Salvador in March 1994, and requested the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to this effect.
II. OPERATIONAL PLAN FOR THE UNITED NATIONS OBSERVATION OF
THE ELECTION AND THE ENLARGEMENT OF ONUSAL
A. Main findings of the technical mission
Prior experience in Angola, Eritrea, Haiti and Nicaragua has shown that United Nations observation requires wide geographical and chronological coverage in order to monitor the conformity of electoral practice to patterns implicit in free and fair elections.
Such coverage fosters acceptance among all concerned of the legitimacy of the process and its final outcome.
In El Salvador, the task will be greatly facilitated by the knowledge and experience that ONUSAL has accumulated since its inception in July 1991.
The main areas of concern identified by the technical mission are the serious inadequacies of the existing electoral roll and the difficulties encumbering the timely issue of electoral documents.
B. Terms of reference
The electoral component of ONUSAL should observe the electoral process before, during and after the elections in order:
To verify that measures and decisions taken by all electoral authorities are impartial and consistent with the holding of free and fair elections;
To verify that appropriate steps are taken so that qualified citizens are included in the electoral roster, thus enabling them to exercise their right to vote;
To verify that mechanisms are in place effectively to prevent multiple voting, given the infeasibility of screening the electoral roll prior to the elections;
To verify that freedom of expression, organization, movement and assembly are respected without restrictions;
To verify that potential voters have sufficient knowledge of the mechanisms for participating in the election;
To examine, analyse and assess criticisms made, objections raised and attempts undertaken to de-legitimize the electoral process and, when required, to convey such information to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal;
To inform the Supreme Electoral Tribunal of complaints received regarding irregularities in electoral advertising or possible interferences with the electoral process; and, when appropriate, to require information on corrective measures taken;
To place observers at every polling site on election day to verify that the right to vote is fully respected;
To assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in preparing periodic reports to the Secretary-General, who will in turn inform the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and report to the Security Council as necessary.
In carrying out its functions, the Electoral Division, under the overall authority of the Special Representative, will coordinate its activities with those of the Human Rights, Police and Military Divisions in their respective spheres of competence.
C. Concept of operations
In order to carry out these duties, an Electoral Division will be established as part of ONUSAL in five stages, as follows:
From 1 to 30 June 1993: preparatory stage, devoted to organization at the central and regional levels;
From 1 July to 15 December 1993: main tasks will be verifying registration of citizens and following political activities;
From 16 December 1993 to 14 March 1994: efforts will concentrate on observation of the electoral campaign;
From 15 to 31 March 1994: observation of the elections, counting of the votes and announcement of the results;
From 1 to 30 April 1994: observation of a possible second round of elections for the presidency; should the first round yield a definitive result, the activities of the Division will conclude on 31 March 1994.
The main tasks of the electoral observers will be to monitor electoral irregularities, receive complaints and convey them, as appropriate, to electoral authorities; to observe political meetings and demonstrations; to follow up and assess electoral advertising and election-related reporting in the media.
The information thus collected will be the basis for analysing trends and acting upon them as required.
These activities will be carried out in close coordination with the Human Rights and Police Divisions.
On election day, the number of observers will increase so as to permit monitoring at every polling site.
The Mission will verify the counting of votes and make projections for its own use and possibly for sharing with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.
The electoral observation will continue after election day to cover all aspects of the counting of votes and possible challenges to results.
The observation will conclude with the official proclamation of final results by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.
III. STATUS OF ASSESSED CONTRIBUTIONS
The status of assessed contributions received and unpaid, taking into account applied credits as at 31 May 1993, is summarized in the table.
Total outstanding assessments of $22,404,703 are due from Member States for ONUCA ($12,192,488) and for ONUSAL ($10,212,215).

IV. VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS
By paragraph 13 of its resolution 47/223 on the financing of ONUCA and ONUSAL, the General Assembly invited voluntary contributions in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General.
For the period under review, the Government of Switzerland continued to make available air ambulance service for the repatriation of those wounded or taken ill in the performance of their duties, as required.
That service was not utilized by the Mission during the period ending on 31 May 1993.
1 DECEMBER 1992 TO 31 MAY 1993
Annex I to the present report sets out by budget-line item the appropriations provided to ONUSAL for the period from 1 December 1992 to 31 May 1993, and the estimated expenditure for the period.
Total expenditure amounted to $15,367,700 gross ($14,367,800 net) for the period.
Supplementary information thereon is provided in annex II.
30 NOVEMBER 1993, INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ELECTORAL COMPONENT
The total cost of ONUSAL for the period from 1 June to 30 November 1993, including its enlargement, is estimated at $20,248,300 gross ($18,341,900 net).
A summary of the consolidated cost estimate for this period is contained in annex III to the present report and supplementary information thereon is presented in annex IV. The estimate takes into consideration the costs related to the proposed net increase of 37 international and 7 local posts and other costs related to the enlargement of the Mission for the electoral process.
The addition of the Electoral Division coincides with the phasing out of the Military Division, both commencing on 1 June 1993.
VII. COST ESTIMATE FOR THE PERIOD FROM 1 DECEMBER 1993
TO 30 APRIL 1994
As outlined in paragraph 18 above, it is anticipated that ONUSAL will complete the observation of the electoral process by 30 April 1994.
Should the first round yield a definite result, the activities of the Electoral Division would conclude on 31 March 1994.
The total cost of ONUSAL for the five-month period from 1 December 1993 to 30 April 1994 is estimated at $20,239,500 gross ($18,474,900 net).
The current six-month mandate of ONUSAL will expire on 30 November 1993.
Accordingly, the Secretary-General requests that the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session make appropriate provision for the expenses of ONUSAL for the period beyond 30 November 1993, should the Security Council decide to continue the Mission.
As recent experience shows, the extensions and enlargements of mandates are sometimes decided upon by the Security Council without an existing financial authorization from the General Assembly.
In order to provide continuing financial authorization prior to the reconvening of the General Assembly, in the event the requirements for extensions or enlargements exceed the provisions of Assembly resolution 46/187 of 20 December 1991 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses, it would be prudent for continuing authorization to exist for ONUSAL, as may be required in other peace-keeping operations.
A summary of the cost estimate for ONUSAL for the period from 1 December 1993 to 30 April 1994 is presented in annex V to the present report and supplementary information thereon is provided in annex VI.
The international posts include the deduction of one D-2 level post of Chief Military Observer and the proposed addition of 38 posts required to support the electoral activities as they are phased in.
VIII. COST ESTIMATE FOR THE LIQUIDATION OF THE MISSION
It is projected that the liquidation of ONUSAL will take some three months to complete.
The cost for the liquidation phase, estimated at $3,219,100 gross ($3,015,100 net), is presented in annex VII and covers the requirements for the closure of the Mission.
Supplementary information thereon is provided in annex VIII. Details on civilian staff and related costs during the liquidation phase are shown in annex XII C. Annex XIV shows the proposed distribution of civilian personnel by office during the liquidation phase.
IX. DISPOSITION OF ASSETS
Since the inception of ONUSAL, a total amount of approximately $8.4 million has been spent on the purchase of non-disposable equipment consisting of vehicles, communication equipment, generators and office furniture and equipment.
It is proposed that, upon the completion of ONUSAL, equipment that conforms with established standardization, is considered compatible with existing equipment, or will be of use in future peace-keeping operations should be placed in reserve.
Items that are not compatible with existing equipment or of use in the future will be disposed of locally.
When such equipment is drawn from the reserve stock, appropriate credit will be recorded in the combined ONUCA/ONUSAL special account.
A full report on the disposition of the assets of ONUSAL will be submitted to the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and to the General Assembly at a later session.
X. FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION
In its resolution 45/265 of 17 May 1991, the General Assembly approved, in the case of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG), special arrangements regarding the application of article IV, regulations 4.3 and 4.4, of the Financial Regulations of the United Nations.
The Assembly thereby extended to UNTAG the special arrangements that had been accorded to the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in resolution 33/13 F of 14 December 1978, to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in resolution 34/9 C of 17 December 1979 and to the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG) in resolution 45/245 of 21 December 1990.
In his report to the General Assembly at its thirty-third session (A/C.5/33/45) on UNEF/UNDOF, the Secretary-General had indicated, inter alia, that the amounts owed to troop-contributing Governments could not be paid in the period envisaged under financial regulation 4.3.
That situation continues to be experienced in peace-keeping operations and in the case of ONUSAL is of particular relevance to amounts relating to travel of military observers, travel of civilian police and death and disability.
The accounts of ONUSAL are currently maintained for the mandate periods for which separate appropriations have been provided.

It is proposed that the standing decision, as contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 45/265 and reproduced above, be extended and applied to ONUSAL.
XI. OBSERVATIONS
By paragraph 9 of its resolution 47/223, the General Assembly decided, inter alia, that the remaining unencumbered balance of ONUCA should be credited to Member States against their assessed contributions for the next mandate period of ONUSAL, should the Security Council renew the mandate of the Mission beyond 31 May 1993.
Annex IX to the present report sets out the financial position resulting from the merging of the special accounts of ONUSAL and ONUCA and shows a total unencumbered balance of $14,835,505 in the combined ONUSAL/ONUCA special account, consisting of $829,032 for ONUSAL and $14,006,473.
As indicated against item 4 in annex IX, total assessed contributions of $22,404,703, made up of $10,212,215 for ONUSAL and $12,192,488 for ONUCA, remained outstanding as at 31 May 1993.
This resulted in an operating deficit of $7,569,198 in the combined ONUSAL/ONUCA special account.
In order to meet the operating cash requirements of ONUSAL, loans amounting to $5 million were made to the ONUSAL special account from the Peace-keeping Reserve Fund.
Because of this, the Secretary-General recommends that no action be taken, at this time, in connection with the unutilized balance of $1,813,985 of ONUCA and that this amount be retained in the combined ONUSAL/ONUCA special account pending receipt of the outstanding assessed contributions for both Missions.
Furthermore, the Secretary-General appeals to all Member States to pay their assessments in full as soon as possible.
FORTY-SEVENTH SESSION
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session in connection with the financing of ONUSAL are as follows:
The appropriation of the amount of $20,248,300 gross ($18,341,900 net) and the apportionment thereof for the enlargement of ONUSAL for the period from 1 June to 30 November 1993 and the apportionment thereof;
With regard to the period after 30 November 1993, provision by means of appropriation and/or commitment authorization, as appropriate, of such amounts, and the apportionment thereof, should the Security Council decide to continue the Mission beyond that date;
The provision by means of appropriation and/or commitment authorization, as appropriate, of such amounts, and the apportionment thereof, to meet the costs associated with the liquidation of ONUSAL, should the Council decide to close the Mission;
A decision to retain the unutilized balance of $1,813,985 in the ONUSAL/ONUCA special account in the light of the outstanding assessed contributions,
A decision that the special arrangements regarding article IV of the Financial Regulations of the United Nations, as set out in paragraph 33 above, be applied to ONUSAL.

Savings/
(overruns)
Military observers .
Additional requirements totalling $184,700 under mission subsistence allowance were partially offset by projected savings of $86,400 under travel. Costs for military observers had been
estimated on the basis of repatriation of 76 observers in January 1993 and 47 in February 1993, whereas a substantial number of military observers were retained in the Mission for a longer time.
The mission subsistence allowance rates for the first 30 days were increased retroactively from $64 to $70 effective 1 February 1992, to $80 effective 1 November 1992 and to $85 effective 1 May 1993 and rates after the first 30 days were
increased from $61 to $68 effective 1 May 1993.
Civilian police . 293 400
Projected savings for mission subsistence allowance ($45,300), travel ($243,500) and clothing allowance ($4,600) resulted from the delay in the planned deployment of 50 additional police monitors.
The projected savings for mission subsistence allowance were offset by the retroactive increases in the mission subsistence allowance rates referred to under item 1.
salaries ($857,200), local staff salaries ($23,900), common staff costs ($733,400), representation allowance ($600) and mission subsistence allowance ($92,400) due to vacancies, were partially offset by additional requirements totalling $10,800 for consultants
and experts ($7,700) and travel ($3,100). Civilian staff costs had been estimated on the basis of 313 authorized personnel, whereas, over the six-month period, actual staff averaged 281.
The resulting savings were offset by the retroactive increases in mission subsistence allowance rates referred to under item 1.
The additional requirements for consultants and travel were due to expenditures of the survey Mission for the establishment of the Electoral Division not previously provided for.
Premises/accommodation . 32 400
Projected savings totalling $52,200 for rental of premises ($13,000), maintenance and alterations ($35,800) and utilities ($3,400), due to reduction in two floors of rented premises for ONUSAL headquarters and closure of the Verification Centres, were
Transport operations . (345 300)
Projected additional requirements of $416,300 for spare parts, repairs and maintenance were partially offset by savings totalling $71,000 for petrol, oil and lubricants ($38,800) and vehicle insurance ($32,200).
The mandate of ONUSAL is heavily dependent on surface transportation, especially the Police component, which is on 24-hour patrol.
The projected additional requirements for spare parts, repairs and maintenance were due to a combination of the high level of traffic accidents, incidents of pilferage of spare parts and increased cost of repairs, as well as high mileage in the
The high incidence of vehicles idled for repairs resulted in savings under petrol, oil and lubricants.
Savings under vehicle insurance were partly due to the low cost of insurance obtained locally.
Helicopter operations . 132 900
Projected savings were realized from basic hire costs ($75,900) and aviation fuel ($57,000).
During the six-month period, the helicopter fleet was gradually reduced from 6 to 2, and aviation fuel consumption was decreased, owing to reduction in flight hours.
Communications . (14 500)
Projected additional requirements of $17,500 for communication parts and supplies, due to higher prices than originally estimated, were partially offset by savings of $3,000 for test and workshop equipment.
Other equipment . 27 300
Projected savings under this heading were realized for office furniture and equipment ($4,800), miscellaneous equipment ($21,300) and parts and repairs ($1,200).
Owing to the delayed arrival of the additional civilian police, the purchase of office furniture and equipment, miscellaneous equipment and spare parts for their use was postponed, thus resulting in savings under this heading.
Supplies and services . (109 900)
without required vaccinations, and general supplies ($99,000), due to increased demand for and cost of photocopying, were partially offset by savings totalling $14,500 for official hospitality ($900), public information - special events ($2,200) and uniform,
Freight and cartage . 17 500
Savings under this heading amounted to $17,500.
Death and disability awards . -
The amount allocated has been obligated to cover potential claims for injuries and disability.

The amount allocated has been transferred to the support account for peace-keeping operations.

III. RECOMMENDATION OF THE FIFTH COMMITTEE
6. The Fifth Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the following draft resolution:
Financing of the United Nations Observer Mission
in El Salvador
The General Assembly,
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/
Bearing in mind Security Council resolutions 693 (1991) of 20 May 1991, by which the Council established the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador, and 729 (1992) of 14 January 1992, by which the Council decided to extend the mandate of the Observer Mission, as well as the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended its mandate, the latest of which was resolution 832 (1993) of 27 May 1993,
Recalling its resolution 46/240 of 22 May 1992, in which it decided, in principle, that the special accounts for the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador and the United Nations Observer Group in Central America should be merged,
Noting the current status of the combined Special Account for the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador and the United Nations Observer Group in Central America,
Reaffirming that the costs of the Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,
Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,
Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,
1/ A/47/751/Add.1.
2/ A/47/983.
Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,
Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,
Expressing concern about the financial situation with regard to the Observer Mission owing to overdue payment by Member States of their assessments, particularly Member States in arrears,
Also expressing concern about the delays in submission of budget documents until well into the financial period of the Observer Mission, which have contributed to the financing difficulties of the Mission,
Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Observer Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy, to improve management and to include in the report on this item to the General Assembly information on the steps taken in this regard;

and Budgetary Questions
[Original: English]
[24 September 1992]
A. General
1. The major functions of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, as defined by the General Assembly in its resolution 14 (I), section A, of 13 February 1946, are:
"(a) To examine and report on the budget submitted by the Secretary-General to the General Assembly;
"(b) To advise the General Assembly concerning any administrative and budgetary matters referred to it;
"(c) To examine on behalf of the General Assembly the administrative budgets of the specialized agencies and proposals for financial arrangements with such agencies;
"(d) To consider and report to the General Assembly on the auditors' reports on the accounts of the United Nations and of the specialized agencies."
In addition, the Advisory Committee reports on administrative budgets and other matters to the governing bodies of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) (voluntary funds), the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the United Nations Environment Programme (Environment Fund), the United Nations Habitat and Human Settlements Foundation, the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR), the United Nations University, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) and the World Food Programme.
2. Under rule 156 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the members of the Advisory Committee, no two of whom shall be nationals of the same State, shall be selected on the basis of broad geographical representation, personal qualifications and experience.
3. The members of the Advisory Committee are:

4. In 1992, the Advisory Committee met in special session in New York from 10 to 14 February and from 9 to 13 March, in regular session in New York from 7 April to 22 May, at The Hague on 26 and 27 May, at Copenhagen on 28 and 29 May, at Geneva from 1 to 12 June, and again in New York in special session from 6 to 17 July.
The present report discusses in general terms the matters that were before the Committee at each of these locations.
B. Meetings in New York
1. Voluntary funds and programmes
5. In New York, the Advisory Committee met with the Administrator of UNDP, and submitted a report (DP/1992/39) to the Governing Council of UNDP at its thirty-ninth session (4-29 May 1992) dealing with:
(a) Revised budget estimates for the biennium 1992-1993 (DP/1992/40);
(b) Report of the Administrator of UNDP on the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Baltic States (DP/1992/51);
(c) Trusts funds established by the Administrator in 1991.
The Committee also had before it a number of other reports referred to in document DP/1992/40.
6. In May, the Advisory Committee met with the Executive Director of UNICEF and submitted to the Executive Board of UNICEF a report dealing with:
(a) Proposed format for global funds programme budgets (E/ICEF/1992/AB/L.1);
(b) Criteria for core versus project posts (E/ICEF/1992/AB/L.15);
(c) Budget format for country programme recommendations (E/ICEF/1992/AB/L.17);
(d) Revisions to the budget format for the administrative and programme support budget (E/ICEF/1992/AB/L.14);
(e) Structure and format of income projections (E/ICEF/1992/AB/L.13);
(h) Recovery of costs for prorated project posts and incremental field overheads on supplementary-funded programmes (E/ICEF/1992/AB/L.8);
(i) Report on headquarters office accommodation (E/ICEF/1992/AB/L.9).
7. The Advisory Committee also considered, at its special session in July, a proposal of UNICEF to relocate its Geneva office, including the Greeting Card Operation, to the International Air Transport Association premises at Geneva.
In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, there is a need for a comprehensive overall plan for accommodation of all United Nations agencies at Geneva, including the United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG), and close inter-agency cooperation with a view to making the most cost-effective arrangements in a coordinated manner, taking into account the long-term space requirements of the agencies concerned, the office space available at Geneva and the current market rates, including offers made by local authorities.
The Committee therefore requested the Executive Director of UNICEF and the Secretary-General to provide additional information in this regard.
The Committee intends to consider the space requirements of UNICEF at Geneva and in New York at its fall session, in the context of a United Nations overall plan for office accommodation, which it has requested.
8. A meeting was held with representatives of the Executive Director of UNFPA to consider a request to transfer credits among programmes.
The Advisory Committee concurred in the transfer.
9. During its session in New York, the Advisory Committee met with the Acting Executive Director of UNITAR to consider the 1992 budgetary proposals for the Institute as submitted in document UNITAR/EX/R.172 and revised pages.
10. The Advisory Committee noted that an advance of some $2 million from the United Nations had been included in the budget proposals.
During the course of the ensuing discussion, the Committee was informed that the United Nations had been paying costs which UNITAR could not meet from voluntary contributions.
The Committee wrote to the Secretary-General to express its concern about the legislative basis for financing UNITAR activities from the regular budget and to request that, pending such action as the General Assembly might take with respect to UNITAR, the Secretary-General should identify appropriations against which to charge the minimum costs relating to the staff of UNITAR.
The Committee also requested the Secretary-General to have the Institute submit a revised budget for consideration by the Advisory Committee and the Board of Trustees.
11. The Advisory Committee further requested the Secretary-General to expedite the preparation of the report on the future role of UNITAR in training programmes within the United Nations system, as requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of its resolution 46/180 of 19 December 1991 and to submit the report for action on a priority basis by the Assembly at its forty-seventh session.
13. In March, the Advisory Committee considered a proposal from UNHCR that it avail itself of the offer made by the Government of Switzerland and move into the Immeuble administratif de Montbrillant.
14. While the Advisory Committee agreed that the terms offered by the Swiss authorities appeared attractive, it indicated that UNHCR should further negotiate the overall terms of the offer; in this connection, the Committee highlighted a number of issues which it believed merited attention.
Subject to those observations, the Advisory Committee did not interpose any objection to UNHCR's proposal to rent accommodations in the Immeuble administratif de Montbrillant.
2. Peace-keeping
15. During its sessions in New York, the Advisory Committee considered a number of reports related to peace-keeping.
In February, the Committee's approval was requested for the utilization of $2.8 million from the support account for peace-keeping operations in the biennium 1992-1993 to meet the cost of renting office space in the Alcoa Building in order to accommodate mission support personnel for peace-keeping operations.
16. While agreeing that additional space was required, the Advisory Committee was not convinced that the arrangement proposed by the Controller to secure such space was the most suitable; the Committee was not in a position to pronounce itself on the proposed method of financing, recalling its intention to consider the question of whether the support account should be charged for common services in the context of the report on the operation of the account, to be submitted in 1992.
17. In the circumstances, the Advisory Committee concurred in the Controller's request for commitment authority, on the understanding that the requested amount should be regarded as a ceiling.
The Committee also requested the Secretary-General to review his options and to report back with an indication of the savings that he had been able to achieve in this regard.
18. In March, the Advisory Committee's approval was sought for 138 additional work-months of temporary assistance and three posts.
The Committee concurred in additional temporary assistance amounting to $605,100, but did not approve the establishment of the three posts.
19. In May, the request was for the establishment of 9 core posts for the Unit for Peace-keeping Matters and Special Assignments, Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Finance, and 24 temporary assistance posts (each for a period of one year) to be distributed within the various areas of the Department of Administration and Management.
In concurring in the request, the Advisory Committee stated its expectation that the revised estimates of the 1992-1993 budget to be submitted to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session, would clearly indicate the role of those posts financed from the regular budget vis-à-vis peace-keeping operations, with clarification on the rationale between "core" and temporary assistance posts, since, in the opinion of the Advisory Committee, all posts funded by the support account should be temporary.
20. During its February session, the Advisory Committee considered a request of the Secretary-General, submitted in accordance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 46/194 of 20 December 1991 concerning the level of commitments to be entered into with regard to the operation of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for the six-month period from 1 February to 31 July 1992.
21. In considering the level of commitments requested by the Secretary-General, i.e. $80,022,000 gross ($78,534,000 net), the Advisory Committee bore in mind that the Security Council, in extending the mandate of UNIFIL for the six-month period through 31 July 1992, had also approved the overall objective outlined in the report of the Secretary-General, 1/ aimed at promoting the greater effectiveness of UNIFIL.
The Council had also approved the recommendations in the report of the Secretary-General 2/ calling for a reduction in the size of the headquarters and support elements of the six infantry battalions and the withdrawal of the heavy mortars with which some of the battalions were equipped.
The Committee was informed that it was not possible to specify when those recommendations would be implemented; however, it was unlikely that the entire amount being requested would be needed.
22. In the circumstances, the Committee concurred in the level of commitments not exceeding $76,672,000 gross for the period in question.
23. The Advisory Committee also considered the Secretary-General's request to utilize an amount not exceeding $8,628,000 gross ($8,136,000 net) for the maintenance of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for the period 1 March to 31 May 1992.
In giving its concurrence, the Committee requested the Secretary-General to submit an updated performance report on the operation and detailed cost estimates for the financial arrangements which would be required to implement such decisions as the Security Council may take on the future of MINURSO.
Subsequently, in July, the Advisory Committee considered the Secretary-General's request to enter into additional commitments not exceeding $7.3 million gross ($7 million net) for the maintenance of MINURSO for the period 1 June to 31 August 1992.
The Advisory Committee concurred in the Secretary-General's request, pending receipt of a report to the General Assembly, which should include, if necessary, details of financial arrangements designed to accommodate modifications in MINURSO's mandate as a result of decisions of the Security Council.
24. In February, the Advisory Committee considered and concurred in the Secretary-General's request to enter into commitments of up to $10 million for the deployment of an additional 25 military liaison officers in Yugoslavia pursuant to Security Council resolutions 727 (1992) of 8 January 1992 and 740 (1992) of 7 February 1992.
Subsequently, in March, the Advisory Committee considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), which is contained in document A/46/236/Add.1 and submitted a report thereon in document A/46/893 to the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session.
In July, the Advisory Committee considered the Secretary-General's request for its approval for the temporary increase of 25 international and 36 local civilian personnel for UNPROFOR.
In giving its concurrence, the Advisory Committee stated its expectation that the Secretary-General would provide to the General Assembly, in the early part of its forty-seventh session, inter alia, the performance report requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 46/233 of 19 March 1992.
25. In February, the Advisory Committee concurred in the Secretary-General's request to enter into commitments of up to $10 million prior to the approval of the budget of the expanded operation of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador by the General Assembly.
In May, the Committee considered that budget, as contained in document A/46/900 and submitted its related report in document A/46/904.
That budget was submitted in document A/46/855; the Advisory Committee's related report was submitted to the General Assembly in document A/46/873.
27. At its session in February, the Advisory Committee considered the report of the Secretary-General, contained in document A/46/235/Add.1, on the financing of the initial phase of the implementation plan of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC); the Committee's related report is contained in document A/46/874.
In May, the Committee also considered a report of the Secretary-General on the financing of UNAMIC and UNTAC (A/46/903); its related report is contained in document A/46/916.
28. In order to set up the United Nations Operation in Somalia and to provide for its maintenance during the initial two-month period, the Secretary-General requested the Advisory Committee's concurrence to enter into commitments in an amount not exceeding $7,410,000 under the terms of General Assembly resolution 46/187 of 20 December 1991 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses for the biennium 1992-1993, pending the submission of a detailed report on the financing of the operation.
The Advisory Committee concurred in the Secretary-General's request.
29. In June, while the Advisory Committee was at Geneva, the Secretary-General requested commitment authority in an amount not to exceed $2.9 million in connection with the operation of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II (UNAVEM II) and its enlarged mandate.
The Committee concurred in the request, which was made pending the submission of the Secretary-General's report on the financing of UNAVEM II in connection with its enlarged mandate.
That report, contained in document A/46/934/Add.1, was considered by the Advisory Committee at its special session in New York in July; the Committee's related report is contained in document A/46/945.
30. The Advisory Committee considered, in July, the Secretary-General's report on the financing of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission.
The purpose of the report was, inter alia, to request the approval of the Advisory Committee as to the level of commitments to be authorized for the six-month period from 9 April to 8 October 1992.
The requirements for this period were estimated at $31,710,000 gross ($30,908,200 net).
However, the Advisory Committee authorized an amount not exceeding $28.5 million, in the belief that it would be possible to continue the operation at a somewhat lower level of expenditure without impeding its performance.
3. Regular budget
31. During its regular session in April/May, the Advisory Committee considered the Secretary-General's statement of programme budget implications of draft resolution A/46/L.57 on the restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields, as contained in document A/C.5/46/83; an oral report was made by the Chairman of the Advisory Committee to the Fifth Committee at its 63rd meeting.
32. The Advisory Committee also considered the Secretary-General's report on the programme budget performance of the United Nations for the biennium 1990-1991 and the request contained therein to commit an amount of $11,971,200 over and above the appropriations approved for the biennium in General Assembly resolution 46/184 C of 20 December 1991.
The Secretary-General's request was submitted pursuant to the same resolution, which provided that in addition to the appropriations approved by the Assembly, a net amount of $13,867,100 might, with the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee, be committed in respect of the regular budget for the biennium 1990-1991.
33. The Advisory Committee did not approve the Secretary-General's request, as it did not believe that an assessment was necessary at that time.
However, the Committee informed the Secretary-General that it would review the necessity of approving an additional appropriation and subsequent assessment in the light of an updated report to be submitted by December 1992 on the status of unliquidated obligations for the biennium 1990-1991.
34. At its resumed session in July, the Advisory Committee, pursuant to its earlier request, received a report from the Secretary-General on the progress of construction of additional conference facilities at the Economic Commission for Africa at Addis Ababa.
In that report, the Secretary-General also informed the Committee of developments regarding the claim submitted by the contractor of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) project at Bangkok (as earlier described in document A/C.5/46/22) and of the United Nations own claim for damages, and requested the Committee's approval to apply interest income earned on the appropriations for the construction project at ESCAP to provide for the $535,000 of the additional site supervision.
The Advisory Committee concurred in the Secretary-General's request.
The Advisory Committee concurred in the Secretary-General's request.
36. At the same session, the Advisory Committee also considered a report of the Secretary-General on the interim secretariat arrangements related to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.
In this connection, the Committee noted that the Conference recommended the establishment of a high-level Commission on Sustainable Development and that specific organizational modalities for the work of the Commission should be decided by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session.
In the meantime, the Secretary-General was requested to ensure adequate interim secretariat arrangements.
37. Without prejudice to the decisions of the General Assembly regarding the establishment of the Commission and any support arrangements, the Secretary-General, after having reviewed the activities to be carried out between 1 August and 31 December 1992, estimated that general temporary assistance would be needed to finance through the end of 1992, the equivalent of one D-2, two D-1, one P-5, one P-4 and three General Service posts; the Committee notes that these are in addition to the posts already approved through the end of 1992 by the Assembly at its forty-sixth session.
38. On the basis of the information before it, the Advisory Committee concurred in the Secretary-General's request for commitment authority; however, it also requested him to review the resources required, including the number and grades of the proposed staff, taking into account their responsibilities and the mandates contained in the relevant decisions of the Conference.
The Committee also informed the Secretary-General that, on the basis of information provided regarding the expenditures incurred under section 11C (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development) of the programme budget, it was of the view that no additional appropriation should be requested for this purpose.
4. Other
39. During its regular session in April/May in New York, the Advisory Committee considered its working procedures.
The Committee intends, in so far as it deems appropriate, to report in greater detail about this matter in the context of its report on the review to be undertaken by the Secretary-General in accordance with section VII, paragraph 2, of General Assembly resolution 46/185 B of 20 December 1991.
40. At the same session, the Advisory Committee considered a letter outlining the current financial position of the Office for the Coordination of United Nations Humanitarian and Economic Assistance Programmes relating to Afghanistan (UNOCA) and seeking its approval for the creation of an extrabudgetary post at the D-2 level for that Office.
In this connection, the Secretary-General stated his belief that the mandate of UNOCA should be extended through 31 December 1992.
Bearing in mind the Secretary-General's intent to suppress four other posts (one ASG and three D-1 posts), the Advisory Committee concurred in the proposal to create the extrabudgetary post at the D-2 level.
At the same time, it indicated that it would revert to this question in the context of its examination of the report of the Secretary-General on the strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian emergency assistance of the United Nations to be submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46/182 of 19 December 1991.
41. Pursuant to its request to the Secretary-General of 15 December 1991 that it be provided with the final audit on UNOCA and detailed recommendations on such corrective measures as warranted by the findings of the internal review and staff regulations, the Advisory Committee received and took note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the update on the results of the audit.
The Committee did not believe that all the issues raised by the internal auditors had been satisfactorily addressed, and it indicated that it would revert to the matter in the context of its examination of the report of the Board of External Auditors and report its views to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session.
42. In February, the Advisory Committee concurred in the Secretary-General's request for the temporary continuation through 31 March 1992 of five posts (one ASG, one D-2 and three D-1 posts) for the Office of the Executive Delegate and the United Nations Guards Contingent for the Inter-Agency Humanitarian Programme in Iraq.
Subsequently, in April, the Advisory Committee also considered and concurred in a request by the Secretary-General for the temporary continuation of the high-level posts for the Inter-Agency Humanitarian Programme in Iraq and the United Nations Guards Contingent for the period 1 April to 30 June 1992.
At the same time, the Committee expressed its serious concern about the top-heavy structure of the Programme and questioned the need for such a large number of senior staff.
The Committee also stated that it expected to be informed of the status of the operation in the context of the Secretary-General's report on the strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian emergency assistance of the United Nations to be submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46/182.
43. At its special session in July, the Committee's concurrence was sought concerning the proposed financial arrangements for the acquisition of a new telephone system and related local area networks (LAN) wiring for all United Nations offices at Nairobi.
As outlined in the Secretary-General's report, the replacement of the telephone system at Gigiri, at an estimated cost of $2.5 million, would provide the additional capacity required in the four additional office buildings that are now being constructed and would resolve problems within the existing obsolete system, which is soon to be replaced.
44. Since most of the usage of the system would be for extrabudgetary activities, tenant financing will cover most of the cost of the project, an exact breakdown of which was provided to the Committee.
The Advisory Committee notes that the total includes an amount of $330,000 from the regular budget, which represents that portion of the appropriation under section 35 (Construction, alteration, improvement and major maintenance) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 that has already been allocated to the regular budget share of the LAN cabling.
The Committee was also informed that no additional resources would be required under the regular budget for the project.
45. On the basis of the information before it, the Committee concurred in the Secretary-General's proposal; at the same time, it stated its belief that the installation of the system might lead to future reductions in clerical and other support staff.
C. Meetings at The Hague
46. At The Hague, the Advisory Committee met with members of the International Court of Justice and its Registrar and discussed various items of concern and interest, one of which was the question of the adequacy of the premises and accommodation of the Court, a problem which in turn relates to the increased number of ad hoc judges in view of the Court's increased case-load.
The Committee also discussed various issues relating to the pension of the members of the Court, the size of the Court Registry staff and other matters pertaining to the Court's budget.
D. Meetings at Copenhagen
47. Bearing in mind General Assembly decision 45/450 of 21 December 1990, in which, inter alia, the Assembly invited the Advisory Committee to continue its consideration of administrative and budgetary issues relevant to more effective coordination among the organizations and programmes of the United Nations system, the Committee decided to focus on the question of coordinated procurement in the United Nations system.
In this connection, the Committee notes that a total of $1,762.8 million in goods and services was procured by the United Nations system in 1991; in other words, the potential cost savings to be realized through an effective, coordinated procurement system are substantial.
The matter of coordinated procurement also featured in the Committee's discussions with the specialized agencies at Geneva.
49. The question of coordinated procurement dates back a number of years.
For example, in June 1977, the Governing Council of UNDP authorized the Administrator of UNDP to set up a small coordinating unit for initial experimental work on the exchange of information and the sharing of techniques on procurement matters among the organizations of the United Nations system.
The office, which was named the Inter-Agency Procurement Services Unit (subsequently changed to the Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office), became operational on 1 January 1978.
The General Assembly, in its resolution 32/197 of 20 December 1977, on the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system, also referred to the matter, recommending, inter alia, that "measures should be taken to achieve maximum uniformity of administrative, financial, budgetary, personal and planning procedures, including the establishment of a common procurement system ...".
Since that time, annual meetings of the heads of procurement services within the United Nations system have been held.
50. Efforts to achieve better coordination in procurement have intensified in recent years.
In this connection, the Advisory Committee, in its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1988-1989, requested the Secretary-General to determine the possible benefits to be derived from a close coordination of the operations of the United Nations Supply Depot at Pisa and those of the UNICEF Procurement and Assembly Centre at Copenhagen. 3/
In September 1988, the Consultative Committee on Administrative Questions (Financial and Budgetary Questions) began reviewing and discussing the subject of coordinated procurement.
51. Subsequently, in December 1990, the Secretary-General announced the establishment of coordinated procurement activities at Copenhagen in order to achieve better coordination in procurement for the United Nations system, including the benefits resulting from standardization, as well as combining orders to take advantage of economies of scale and standardization.
At the same time, a Steering Committee composed of representatives from the United Nations, UNDP, UNICEF and UNHCR (which together account for approximately 65 per cent of the total procurement volume of the United Nations system in a given year) was set up to oversee further work aimed at reducing cost and improving services.
In announcing the establishment of this Steering Committee, the Secretary-General stated that it would be assisted by the Coordinated Procurement Working Group, composed of senior staff members of the various organizations responsible for procurement and contracting activities, and he urged other organizations within the United Nations system to participate in the Working Group.
52. In its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 (issued in August 1991), the Advisory Committee noted the establishment of the Steering Committee and stated its view that greater inter-agency coordination and cooperation should be encouraged. 4/
53. Significant progress has been achieved to date in a number of areas relating to the establishment of a cost effective procurement system.
For example, the common-user items which could benefit from some form of coordinated or central purchasing arrangements have been identified and agreed upon.
Furthermore, a standardization programme for motor vehicles (the largest category of common-user items) has been adopted by all organizations in the system and the first collective international bidding exercise for this commodity group has been completed.
In addition, a common coding system has been adopted by the United Nations system for classification of all equipment, supplies and services.
Such a system is a prerequisite for an inter-agency exchange of data, compilation of system-wide reliable statistics and central analysis of data.
54. The Advisory Committee is encouraged by these developments.
55. The Advisory Committee agrees with this approach; to this end, it encourages the participants of the Steering Committee (the United Nations, UNICEF, UNDP and UNHCR) not to lose momentum and to redouble their efforts to address the outstanding administrative and financial issues which must be resolved in order for the system fully to realize the benefit.
E. Meetings at Geneva
56. While at Geneva, the Advisory Committee met with the Director-General of UNOG, with the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) and with representatives of the specialized agencies.
57. Although the Committee traditionally meets with JIU each time it visits Geneva, this year's meetings were considerably more involved in view of General Assembly decision 46/446 of 20 December 1991, in paragraph (g) of which the Assembly:
"requested the Advisory Committee, within its mandate and with due respect to the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit, to examine the functioning of the Joint Inspection Unit, including the proposals thereon contained in paragraphs 12 to 16 of the 1991 report of the Unit, and taking into account the views of the Unit on this subject, to submit to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session recommendations for the enhancement of the productivity and performance of the Unit".
59. The Advisory Committee also raised the subject of JIU during meetings with representatives of the specialized agencies.
The Advisory Committee sought and received information from a number of the agencies about the extent of their contacts with the Unit, their use of the Unit's reports and their ideas for enhancing the Unit's performance and productivity.
60. In keeping with its recent practice to concentrate on specific matters of system-wide concern, the Advisory Committee also pursued the question of coordinated procurement with the agencies (see para. 53 above).
61. The Advisory Committee continued its discussion with the agencies on ways and means of making its work in administrative and budgetary coordination more relevant.
It was generally agreed that concentrating on a topic of system-wide concern was more useful than in-depth examination of individual agency budgets; by the time the Advisory Committee would be able to examine these budgets (in even-numbered years), most would have already been approved, and even if this weren't the case, the amount of work involved would be prohibitive given the scope of the Advisory Committee's responsibilities in other areas.
62. It was noted that the statistical information which used to be collected by the Advisory Committee and reported to the General Assembly will henceforth be produced by the Administrative Committee on Coordination and issued by the Secretary-General.
The agencies and the Advisory Committee are continuing to explore the possibility of regular meetings with the Consultative Committee on Administrative Questions (Financial and Budgetary Questions), perhaps to take place in the fall of odd-numbered years.
63. During its session at Geneva, the Advisory Committee also met with the Director of UNIDIR and representatives of the Secretary-General to consider the Institute's draft work programme and proposed budget for 1993, as prepared by the Institute.
In accordance with the procedures outlined in article VIII of the statute of the Institute, the Committee submitted its report to the Board of Trustees of UNIDIR.

Second report
Revised estimates as requested by the General Assembly in its
resolutions 46/185 B and 46/232 - Section 15 (United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development): report of the
the subprogramme on trade among countries having different
economic and social systems - Review of the Office of Conference Services
[7 October 1992]
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) has considered the report of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/47/2 and Corr.1) in which he submits revised estimates as requested by the General Assembly in its resolutions 46/185 B of 20 December 1991 and 46/232 of 2 March 1992.
The Advisory Committee also considered the Secretary-General's reports relating to section 15 (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)) (A/C.5/47/7) and the Office of Conference Services (A/47/336).
I. REVISED ESTIMATES
2. In its resolution 46/232, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit to it a report "on the programmatic impact as well as the financial implications of organizational changes involved in his initiatives and the progress attained in accordance with the present resolution". However, the Secretary-General states in paragraph 2 of document A/C.5/47/2 and Corr.1 that his report is centred on the financial aspects of the restructuring of the Secretariat undertaken to date, which involved "changes in the organizational structure of the Secretariat at Headquarters, the abolition of a number of high-level posts and the redistribution of Professional and General Service posts".
According to the Secretary-General, the programme of activities adopted by the General Assembly in the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 has not been directly affected by the restructuring and "the future programmatic consequences of the reorganization of the Secretariat are covered in the revisions to the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 to be considered by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session".
Specific results might be reflected in the current programme budget through additional revised estimates or in the next programme budget" (A/C.5/47/2 and Corr.1, para. 25).
The Secretary-General adds that "the main provisions of the outline for the programme budget for 1994-1995 will have to be considered in this perspective" (ibid.).
4. In addition to the above-mentioned organizational changes, 18 high-level posts enumerated in paragraph 6 of the report were abolished, resulting in an estimated direct savings of $4.4 million.
As shown in table II of the report, that amount is slightly offset by an increase of $134,500 under the heading of transfers between sections, which the Advisory Committee was informed relates to proposed transfers of posts to other duty stations.
5. With regard to the transfer of posts, the Secretary-General states that since consolidation was one of the major thrusts of his initiative, the great majority of the Professional posts affected by the restructuring were simply reassigned to the new or enlarged departments; however, 18 Professional posts, mostly with their incumbents, were redeployed among those departments and offices (ibid., para. 9).
This was in large measure the result of the redistribution of the functions of the former Office for Research and the Collection of Information.
In addition, the Advisory Committee was informed that 74 vacant posts were identified for redeployment following an analysis of the staff resources available to departments.
Nine of these were immediately redeployed as described in paragraph 9 of the Secretary-General's report; as stated in paragraph 22 of that report, the remaining posts (i.e., 65) and their related resources appear under their departments or offices of origin in the relevant tables provided in the Secretary-General's report.
A breakdown by section of the initial 18 redeployments and the subsequent 9 redeployments is provided in table IV of the Secretary-General's report; the treatment of the remaining 65 posts is discussed in paragraphs 8 and 9 below.
6. As shown in table II of the report, the appropriations approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 46/186 A of 20 December 1991 related to 36 expenditure sections of the programme budget; as also shown in table II, the revised estimates relate to 41 sections.
In this connection, the Secretary-General notes in paragraph 13 of his report that, for the purpose of the revised estimates, it was decided to make the transfers of posts and resources effective 1 July 1992.
In other words, to maintain the proper recording of expenditures in 1992, the 36 original sections have been maintained.
As stated in paragraph 14 of the report, a review of the section structure will take place in the context of the preparation of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
7. Table II of the Secretary-General's report provides, in financial terms, a comparison between the original appropriations by section and revised estimates for 27 budget sections; this is supported by narratives by budget section.
In paragraph 98, the Secretary-General requests the General Assembly to approve the transfers between budget sections, noting that the net reduction resulting from the transfers and the savings generated by the abolition of high-level posts is estimated at $4,307,500.
8. In addition to the above, the Secretary-General's report includes a discussion/proposal on the treatment of vacancies in the Secretariat (ibid., paras. 16-24).
As mentioned above, a total of 74 vacant posts were identified for redeployment, 9 of which were immediately redeployed and reflected as such in the Secretary-General's report.
In paragraph 23 of his report, the Secretary-General states that some of the remaining posts (i.e., 65) "might be redeployed, or used in their departments of origin, for a short period or for the remaining part of the biennium before these revised estimates are considered by the General Assembly".
He goes on to explain that the Assembly would be informed accordingly of such decisions which would be taken in relation to the immediate needs of various parts of the Secretariat.
In this connection, the Advisory Committee was informed that as of 25 September 1992, 22 of the 65 posts had been temporarily redeployed for an initial period of six months as shown in the table below:
No. of posts Redeployed to
6 Department of Political Affairs
5 Centre for Human Rights
4 Office of the Secretary-General
2 Department of Peace-keeping Operations
2 Department of Humanitarian Affairs
3 Others
9. As also indicated in paragraph 23 of the report, the Secretary-General, bearing in mind the decisions taken by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session, would propose to use the remaining posts "in the light of new initiatives and emerging mandates and priorities".
10. In the opinion of the Secretary-General, this treatment of vacancies has been "prompted by financial and other constraints as well as by the need to increase flexibility in the use of limited human resources" (ibid., para. 24).
With regard to the latter point, he emphasizes the "difficulty of establishing a precise relationship between staff resources and specific mandated activities" (ibid., para. 18); moreover, because techniques such as workload analysis remain imperfect, that relationship is not scientific.
11. The Secretary-General goes on to explain that "the current mechanisms for adjusting staff resources to changing requirements are the statements of programme budget implications through which the Secretary-General may seek additional posts, and the transfer of posts as well as other resources from one section of the budget to another, which requires the approval of the General Assembly or the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) in between sessions of the Assembly" (ibid.).
Such mechanisms do not, in the opinion of the Secretary-General, permit a rapid response to changing needs and circumstances.
12. That being the case, the Secretary-General, as mentioned above, sees a need for increasing his flexibility; in this connection, he suggests establishing "an internal procedure through which the continuing relevance and rational use of posts that become vacant during the course of the biennium would be examined" (ibid., para. 24).
In his opinion, "such assessments would make it possible to determine if vacant posts should be filled in the programmes in which they were initially budgeted, should be transferred immediately to another programme or should be temporarily frozen.
The resulting transfers of posts between sections of the programme budget would be reported to the Assembly through ACABQ" (ibid.).
In this connection, the Secretary-General states his intention to elaborate the practical modalities for implementing this approach, including the appropriate involvement of ACABQ and the Assembly.
Observations of the Advisory Committee
13. The Advisory Committee's consideration of the Secretary-General's report was hampered in large part because of the lack of information therein.
Notwithstanding the Secretary-General's statement that the programme of activities has not been directly affected by the restructuring (ibid., para. 2), the Advisory Committee regrets that some information in this regard was not included.
That same regret was expressed by the Committee for Programme and Coordination (CPC), which recommended in paragraph 262 of part two of its report, 1/ that the General Assembly be provided with information on the programmatic aspects of the revised estimates.
14. The Advisory Committee also regrets the lack of information regarding the structure and functioning of the new departments and offices, as well as a functional justification in respect of the redeployment of posts.
In this connection, the Committee was informed that because the process of restructuring was ongoing, the Secretariat had not been in a position to provide such information.
The Committee points out that the process of restructuring must have been preceded by an analysis and is therefore of the view that information in this regard should have been provided.
In any case, the Committee was informed that, in view of its request and that of CPC, an attempt would be made to provide additional information to the General Assembly.
The Committee was also informed of the Secretary-General's intention to report to the Assembly on the results of additional proposals for restructuring.
15. Meanwhile, the Advisory Committee wishes to point out that it appreciates the practical difficulties which would result in the event that the budget structure fails to correspond to the organizational structure of the Secretariat (e.g., with regard to the issuance of allotments, performance reporting and auditing).
Other adjustments, such as those included in the performance reports, will be necessary.
In this connection, the Committee points out that the savings arising from vacancies will be dealt with in the context of the first performance report.
17. As mentioned above, the Secretary-General's report contains, in addition to the revised estimates per se, his proposal concerning the treatment of vacant posts in the light of his stated need to increase flexibility in the use of human resources; the Advisory Committee also has a number of observations to make in this regard.
18. The Advisory Committee discussed this matter at length with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided the Committee with a number of clarifications.
19. As mentioned above, the current procedure governing the transfers of posts/resources requires the approval of the General Assembly/ACABQ; this is in conformity with financial regulation 4.5 and financial rule 104.4.
In this connection, representatives of the Secretary-General stressed that the Secretary-General's report does not propose any change in the regulation or in the rule; indeed, the intent is to use them to a greater extent, it being the Secretary-General's view that, in an Organization with expanding mandates in a number of areas, transfer of resources should be a normal practice.
20. Representatives of the Secretary-General explained that the authority for most transfers is currently done on an ex post facto basis through the submission of expenditure reports on each section after the accounts are closed; in other words, contrary to the spirit of financial regulation 4.5 and financial rule 104.4, there is no meaningful involvement of the General Assembly or ACABQ regarding the transfer of resources/posts during the execution of a programme budget.
However, it would be the Secretary-General's intention to apply the provisions of the above-quoted financial regulation and rule.
It would be the Secretary-General's intention to develop this practice and monitor it centrally.
22. Representatives of the Secretary-General stressed that the proposal of the Secretary-General, as explained in his report, would ensure that when a post becomes vacant, its continued relevance for the programme in which it was budgeted would be examined.
The Committee was informed that, subject to this examination, the expectation was that in the majority of cases the posts would remain in their department of origin and the normal procedure for internal promotion or external recruitment would apply, or posts would be proposed for transfer to other sections in conformity with the above-mentioned financial regulation and rule.
23. The Advisory Committee was informed that the rationale for more transfer of resources among sections and for a greater mobility of staff and posts is to increase the capacity of the Secretariat to implement the mandates entrusted to the Organization by Member States.
Furthermore, the Committee requests additional information relating to: (a) the difficulties faced in the implementation of existing financial regulations and rules governing the redeployment of resources/posts among sections; (b) the section structure of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995; and (c) a breakdown of vacancies by section of the budget and specific justification for the proposed redeployment of posts.
25. As indicated in paragraph 1 of the Secretary-General's report (A/C.5/47/7), pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46/185 C of 20 December 1991 section IX, proposals for 1993 are submitted with regard to the 13 posts relating to programmes 13 and 14 of section 15 (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) of the programme budget and enumerated in paragraph 2 of the Secretary-General's report.
26. As stated in paragraph 8 of his report, the Secretary-General "proposes to extend all the 13 posts ... through 1993 on a temporary basis and to make proposals concerning the future status of those posts in the context of the programme budget proposals for the biennium 1994-1995, in the light of the results of the internal review of the UNCTAD secretariat".
The financial implications that extending these posts for one year through 1993 would entail are estimated at $1,311,000, as outlined in paragraph 10 of the report; in addition, an amount of $306,100 would be required under section 36 (Staff assessment), to be offset by an increase in the same amount under income section 1 (Income from staff assessment).
27. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 12 of the report that the Secretary-General proposes to finance this extension by use of any vacant posts in UNCTAD which, following the review of its secretariat currently under way, might be identified as available for redeployment; in addition, vacancies from other sections of the budget would be utilized on a temporary basis to finance any of the 13 posts not financed through vacancies in UNCTAD.
28. The Advisory Committee has no objection to this course of action on the understanding that details will be provided, in due course, in respect of the redeployments and that no additional appropriations would be required for this purpose under section 15.
III. REVIEW OF THE OFFICE OF CONFERENCE SERVICES
29. As recalled in paragraph 1 of the Secretary-General's report (A/47/336), the review of the Office of Conference Services was undertaken pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46/190 of 20 December 1991, in which the Assembly, inter alia, requested the Secretary-General to submit his recommendations to the Assembly through the Advisory Committee and the Committee on Conferences.
30. The comments of the Committee on Conferences on the review are contained in section IV of its report; 2/ the Advisory Committee considers that the Secretary-General could have been more forthcoming in his proposals.
31. The Advisory Committee notes that the Secretary-General refers to a number of areas where productivity gains have been realized following the introduction of technological innovations; in other areas, such gains are anticipated.
However, an attempt should have been made to quantify such gains, as difficult as that task might have been; the Committee trusts that more information will be provided in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
32. The Secretary-General states that none of the recommendations proposed for implementation during the biennium 1992-1993 has financial implications in that they either do not involve expenditures or they are to be implemented within the financial resources provided for in the 1992-1993 programme budget.
Notwithstanding the above, the Advisory Committee is of the view that, with regard to problems identified in the report or areas which would benefit from additional work, the provision of statistical supporting data would have enhanced the report.
33. With regard to the biennium 1994-1995, the Secretary-General states that possible innovations or reforms highlighted by the review will be studied further, in the context of the overall resource availability and other priorities for possible inclusion in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
As stated in paragraph 39 of the report, these include development of subsystems for the Documents Records, Information and Tracking System.
The Advisory Committee points out that the development of a subsystem at Vienna relates to the overall question of conference services at Vienna, a matter on which the Committee will again be reporting in due course.

Third report
Construction of additional conference facilities at
Addis Ababa and Bangkok
[30 October 1992]
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the annual progress report of the Secretary-General on the status of the two construction projects at the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) at Addis Ababa and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific at Bangkok (A/C.5/47/11).
During its consideration of that report, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General who provided additional information.
The Advisory Committee notes that the contractor submitted a claim on 28 April 1992 for ECU (European Currency Unit) 7,680 per day for such expenses, which would amount to ECU 437,760 for 57 days (approximately $600,000 at current rates).
The Committee also notes that this claim is currently being reviewed.
3. The Advisory Committee was informed that, in addition to the above-mentioned claim, the contractor submitted a second claim, which amounts to ECU 10,496,143 (approximately $14 million).
The contractor also requested 244 days of extension of time for completion.
It was the view of representatives of the Secretary-General that the second claim, which represents 20 per cent of the base contract amount of ECU 52,655,450, is very high.
The Committee shares this view and notes with concern the high level of claims received from the contractor, as compared to the progress of work.
In this connection, the Committee trusts that any settlement regarding these claims would be absorbed within the present project budget and, as stated by the Secretary-General in paragraph 14 of his report, there would be no need to revise the total estimated project cost.
4. The Advisory Committee requests that it be provided with a progress report on the ECA project at its spring 1993 session.
In addition to including information covering the project's timetable and the status of work, the report should include developments regarding the negotiation of the contractor's claims and the ways and means of ensuring that the overall costs are kept within the approved budget.

Fourth report
Administrative arrangements for the secretariat of the
United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation
[4 November 1992]
1. The General Assembly, in section XI, paragraph 3, of its resolution 46/185 C of 20 December 1991 requested the Secretary-General to study the possibility of alternative arrangements for the secretariat of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), including its possible merger with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and to report to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session.
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the Secretary-General's report (A/C.5/47/26) on the subject.
2. The Advisory Committee notes that UNSCEAR is served by a small secretariat, currently consisting of one Professional and two General Service staff members; a second Professional post has not been filled since 1980.
For reasons mentioned in paragraph 4 of the report, documents for review by UNSCEAR are prepared mainly through consultants who are experts/scientists.
3. Pursuant to a decision taken by the General Assembly on 18 December 1973, the secretariat of UNSCEAR was transferred from New York to Vienna, with effect from 1 January 1974.
The initial reason for the transfer to a European location was to establish links with the Geneva regional office of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and to assist in establishing environmental monitoring and assessment activities within UNEP by making available UNSCEAR experience.
Instead of transferring the secretariat to Geneva, however, the Assembly accepted the offer of accommodation made by the Government of Austria.
Since 1979, with the establishment of the United Nations Office at Vienna (UNOV), administrative services for UNSCEAR have been assumed by UNOV.
4. With regard to the proposal for a possible merger of the UNSCEAR secretariat with IAEA, for reasons given in paragraphs 9 to 14 of his report, the Secretary-General recommends that the present organizational location and administrative support arrangements for the UNSCEAR secretariat be maintained.
5. The Committee points out, however, that the Secretary-General has only examined the possibility of a merger of the UNSCEAR secretariat with that of IAEA.
The Advisory Committee therefore recommends that as requested in General Assembly resolution 46/185/C, section XI, paragraph 3, other possible alternatives for the organizational location and administrative support arrangements for the UNSCEAR secretariat be explored.
Furthermore, the Committee questions the rationale with regard to its inclusion in section 17 (United Nations Environment Programme) of the programme budget, and believes that these matters should be examined and reviewed in the context of both the restructuring exercise within the Secretariat and the preparation of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
The Committee also notes in this regard that the system-wide implications of this matter, including the use of related available expertise within the system, can be taken into account by the Secretary-General in his capacity as Chairman of the Administrative Committee on Coordination.

Fifth report
Revised estimates resulting from resolutions and decisions
of the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1992
[13 November 1992]
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/47/21), in which he submits revised estimates attributable to resolutions and decisions adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1992.
During its consideration of the above-mentioned report, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General who provided additional information.
2. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 2 of the Secretary-General's report that the total estimated requirements arising out of resolutions and decisions adopted by the Economic and Social Council amount to $2,158,900 for the biennium 1992-1993 and $5,132,800 for the biennium 1994-1995, totalling $7,291,700.
3. As shown in paragraph 3 of the Secretary-General's report, the total requirements cover both substantive ($3,183,700) and conference-servicing ($4,108,000) costs.
4. With regard to the conference-servicing costs, which were calculated on a full-cost basis for the biennium 1992-1993 ($1,244,200), the Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 4 of the Secretary-General's report that, since provisions have been made in the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 not only for meetings already known at the time of the budget preparation, but also for meetings or extensions of such meetings that may be authorized subsequently, no additional resources would be required.
5. As pointed out in paragraph 5 of the report of the Secretary-General, the non-conference-servicing costs for the biennium 1992-1993, arising from the resolutions and decisions adopted by the Economic and Social Council, are estimated at $914,700.
Of that amount, $572,200 relate to the full cost of preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace (Council decision 1992/272 of 30 July 1992), for which an appropriation of $522,200 has already been approved in the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
Consequently, net requirements would amount to $392,500.
6. For reasons stated in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Secretary-General's report, additional net requirements for activities derived from resolutions and decisions of the Economic and Social Council not provided for in the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 and requiring use of the contingency fund are estimated at $292,500.
7. As pointed out in paragraph 8 of the report of the Secretary-General, a total appropriation of $292,500 would therefore be required under sections 21 (Social development and humanitarian affairs), 23 (Economic Commission for Africa), 24 (Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific), 26 (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean), 27 (Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia) and 28 (Human rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
Further details are provided in paragraphs 9 to 28 of the Secretary-General's report by resolution and decision and relevant budget section.
8. A review of alternatives in the event that these estimates would exceed the balance available in the contingency fund is contained in paragraphs 29 to 31 of the Secretary-General's report.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the above information was communicated to the legislative bodies concerned.
The Advisory Committee was also informed that, as at 4 November 1992, the remaining available balance in the contingency fund is $15,237,100.
9. The Advisory Committee has no objection to the Secretary-General's estimate of additional requirements in the biennium 1992-1993, totalling $292,500, attributable to Economic and Social Council resolutions 1992/17 and 1992/18 of 30 July 1992 and Council decisions 1992/259 of 20 July 1992 and 1992/271 and 1992/272 of 30 July 1992.
Accordingly, the Committee recommends that, at this stage, the Fifth Committee should take note of the above estimate on the understanding that such additional appropriations as may be requested by the Secretary-General will be submitted to the General Assembly towards the end of its forty-seventh session in the context of a consolidated statement of programme budget implications and revised estimates, in accordance with Assembly resolution 42/211 of 21 December 1987, annex, section C, paragraphs 5 and 6.

Sixth report
Standards of accommodation for air travel
[16 November 1992]
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on standards of accommodation for air travel (A/C.5/47/17).
2. The report, which covers the period from 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1992, has been submitted pursuant to General Assembly decision 44/442 of 21 December 1989 in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to continue to submit to it annual reports on standards of accommodation for air travel, and Assembly decision 46/450 of 20 December 1991.
The report also includes information on all expenditures incurred by the United Nations for first-class travel and on the meetings attended by eminent persons for whom exceptions have been made for first-class air travel, as requested by the Assembly in its decision 40/455 of 18 December 1985 and section XIII of its resolution 45/248/A of 21 December 1990.
3. As recalled in the report of the Secretary-General, the General Assembly, in its resolution 42/214 of 21 December 1987, authorized the Secretary-General to exercise his discretion in making exceptions to allow first-class travel on a case-by-case basis.
In accordance with administrative instruction ST/AI/249/Rev.3, business-class travel may also, in certain circumstances, be authorized by the Secretary-General.
During the period under review, that is, from 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1992, the Secretary-General authorized 112 cases of first-class travel and 55 cases of business-class travel as exceptions to the standards of accommodation; the total additional costs incurred as a result of these exceptions amounted to $199,675, which compares to a figure of $106,600 for the previous reporting period.
4. Tables 2 and 3 of the Secretary-General's report summarize, by category of exception, the number of exceptions granted during the current and previous reporting periods, respectively; as noted in paragraph 10 of the report, "a significant increase in exceptions was attributable to the category 'eminent persons'".
The total number of exceptions in this category in the previous reporting period was 34, at a cost of $34,093, while the number of such exceptions amounted to 78 during the current reporting period, at a cost of $91,071.
5. In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, the standards of accommodation, as set forth in General Assembly resolution 42/214, should be brought to the attention of all eminent persons whose travel will be financed by the Organization.
In this connection, the Committee reiterates its previously expressed view that, while not opposed in principle to the granting of exceptions, it trusts that they will be granted carefully and selectively.
6. The Committee is also of the view that the Secretary-General's report would be enhanced if information were provided in respect of which source of funding (for example, regular budget, trust funds, United Nations Development Programme, and so on) has been used to finance the additional cost attributable to the granting of exceptions to the prevailing standards of travel; it recommends that future reports include such information.

Seventh report
Administrative and financial implications of the decisions and
recommendations contained in the report of the International
Civil Service Commission - Representation allowance for
under-secretaries-general and assistant secretaries-general
[30 November 1992]
During its consideration of the statement and the report, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.
2. The Advisory Committee points out that the compensation of its Chairman and the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of ICSC, whose conditions of service are distinct and separate from those of Secretariat officials, is reviewed separately every five years by the General Assembly on the basis of proposals from the Secretary-General; the next such review is scheduled for 1995.
I. ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF
THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND DECISIONS CONTAINED IN THE REPORT OF ICSC
3. As indicated by the Secretary-General in paragraph 1 of his statement, the decisions and recommendations of the Commission that would entail financial implications for the biennium 1992-1993 relate to the following issues:
(a) Remuneration of the Professional and higher categories of staff: base/floor salary scale;
(b) Methodology for the determination of dependency allowances for the Professional and higher categories;
(c) Comprehensive review of conditions of service of assistant secretaries-general, under-secretaries-general and equivalent levels;
(d) Methodology to determine the level of the education grant and review of the level of the education grant.
4. As can be seen from the table in paragraph 34 of the Secretary-General's statement, the financial implications for the United Nations regular budget for 1993, as a result of the decisions and recommendations of ICSC, are estimated at $3,623,900.
As noted in paragraph 3, that scale "was part of an integrated package in which negative classes of post adjustment were eliminated: it is used also to calculate payments under the mobility and hardship scheme, as well as separation payments".
6. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 5 of the Secretary-General's statement that, because of salary increases in the comparator civil service, the Commission has recommended an increase of 6.9 per cent, effective 1 March 1993, in the current base/floor salary scale through the consolidation of classes of post adjustment.
The costs to the United Nations regular budget would amount to $1,040,900 for 1993; as shown in paragraph 34, most of that amount relates to anticipated payments under the mobility/hardship matrix.
7. As stated in paragraph 6 of the Secretary-General's statement, the implementation of the above-mentioned recommendation would also necessitate an increase of $8,811,600 for 1993 under section 36 (Staff assessment), to be offset by an increase in the same amount under income section 1 (Income from staff assessment).
8. The methodology for the determination of dependency allowances for the Professional and higher categories is covered in paragraphs 7 to 9 of the Secretary-General's statement.
Those allowances comprise the children's allowance and the secondary dependant's allowance.
9. Following its review of the present methodology, the Commission recommended to the General Assembly its retention.
The Commission also recommended that the current level of the children's allowance should be increased by 21 per cent and that of the secondary dependant's allowance by 50 per cent, both effective 1 January 1993.
The costs to the United Nations regular budget would be $1,165,100 for 1993.
10. The comprehensive review of conditions of service of assistant secretaries-general and under-secretaries-general is discussed in paragraphs 10 to 30 of the Secretary-General's statement; the Commission's recommendations in this regard relate to four items: net remuneration, housing arrangements, pensions and representation allowances.
No financial implications for these were given by ICSC; as stated in paragraph 29 of the Secretary-General's statement, the United Nations has estimated the costs to the regular budget for 1993 in respect of the four items and staff assessment.
11. With regard to net remuneration, the Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 14 of the Secretary-General's statement that ICSC, having recommended an increase in net remuneration for staff at the assistant secretary-general and under-secretary-general levels in the range of 7 to 11 per cent, also recommended that the specific level of increases should be determined by the General Assembly in the light of such recommendations as the Secretary-General might wish to make.
12. In paragraph 20 of his statement, the Secretary-General states that "in light of the measures taken to restructure the Secretariat of the United Nations, as well as the working level equivalents established by ICSC with the Executive Schedule of the comparator civil service, an increase of 9 per cent for under-secretaries-general and 7.5 per cent for assistant secretaries- general would be justified at this time".
In view of the fact that the restructuring of the Secretariat is still continuing, as indicated by the Secretary-General in his statement to the Fifth Committee 2/, the Advisory Committee recommends that consideration of this issue by the General Assembly should be deferred until the process has been completed.
13. With regard to housing arrangements for staff at these levels, the Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 21 of the Secretary-General's statement that the Commission has reiterated its recommendation made in 1990 and 1991; should the General Assembly approve that recommendation, the cost to the United Nations regular budget has been estimated at $204,000 for 1993.
14. As far as the issue of pensions is concerned, the Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 23 of the Secretary-General's statement that the Commission recommends that the pensionable remuneration scale for staff at those levels be adjusted commensurate with changes in remuneration, but that alternative pension arrangements should be deferred; should the General Assembly approve this recommendation, the cost to the United Nations regular budget has been estimated at $67,200 for 1993.
15. In paragraphs 26 to 28 of his statement, the Secretary-General discusses the practice of some staff members of receiving national subsidies to supplement their emoluments.
In that regard, the Advisory Committee notes that the Secretary-General "intends, in conjunction with the introduction of a revised remuneration package for staff at the assistant secretary-general and under-secretary-general level, to require such staff to reaffirm that they do not receive any supplement to or pay any deduction from their emoluments to their national authorities".
16. The methodology to determine the level of the education grant and the review of the level of the education grant are dealt with in paragraphs 31 to 33 of the Secretary-General's statement.
Should the General Assembly approve that recommendation, the cost to the United Nations regular budget has been estimated at $704,400 for 1993.
II. REPRESENTATION ALLOWANCE FOR UNDER-SECRETARIES-GENERAL
AND ASSISTANT SECRETARIES-GENERAL AND HOSPITALITY FOR
17. As recalled in paragraph 3 of the Secretary-General's report (A/C.5/47/39), the General Assembly, by its resolution 46/185 A of 20 December 1991, concurred in the Advisory Committee's recommendation and decided to defer until its forty-seventh session consideration of this question.
18. For reasons given in paragraph 5 of his report, the Secretary-General recommends that the representation allowance of under-secretaries-general and assistant secretaries-general be established by direct reference to salary in amounts equal to one month net remuneration.
19. The Secretary-General proposes to introduce the increase in the level of the representation allowance on a gradual basis over the period 1993-1996 and the amounts would be established as follows: 60 per cent of monthly net remuneration in 1993; 70 per cent in 1994; 80 per cent in 1995; and 100 per cent in 1996.
The Advisory Committee points out that this is not the basis upon which the representation allowance has been paid hitherto, nor is it the basis upon which the representation allowances of the Secretary-General and the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme have been established.
It would also have the effect of establishing differentials in dollar amounts payable to officials of the same level depending on their duty station.
20. The Advisory Committee's recommendation with regard to the representation allowance of under-secretaries-general and assistant secretaries-general is the same as the one made in paragraph 12 above on net remuneration for staff at those levels, that is, that consideration of this issue be deferred until the restructuring process has been completed.

Eighth report
Revised estimates under section 24 (Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific), section 21D
(Crime prevention and criminal justice) and section 27
(Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia)
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the reports of the Secretary-General on revised estimates under section 24 (Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific) (ESCAP) (A/C.5/47/29), section 21D (Crime prevention and criminal justice) (A/C.5/47/40) and section 27 (Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia) (ESCWA) (A/C.5/47/41), of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
During its consideration of the reports, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.
2. The Secretary-General recalls in paragraph 2 of his report (A/C.5/47/29) that the changing circumstances and priorities of the region and, in particular, the process of transition of several centrally planned economies in the region to a market economy, have presented ESCAP with new responsibilities and reaffirmed the need to strengthen regional cooperation.
The Advisory Committee notes that the Commission, on the recommendation of a Group of Eminent Persons, adopted resolution 48/2 of 23 April 1992 on restructuring the conference structure of the Commission, which was approved by the Economic and Social Council in its decision 1992/290 of 31 July 1992 and resulted in revisions to programme 31 (Regional cooperation for development in Asia and the Pacific) of the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 (ibid., paras. 4 and 5).
The Advisory Committee further notes that the Committee for Programme and Coordination, at its thirty-second session, recommended to the General Assembly the approval of the revisions to programme 31, with the modifications as stated in paragraph 87 of part one of its report, 1/, which will provide the framework for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995 (A/C.5/47/29, para. 6).
3. The Secretary-General estimates that additional requirements for outside expertise not available in ESCAP for activities related to countries that are in transition to a market economy as well as to the response to Agenda 21, adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, 2/ and to the problems faced by the least developed, land-locked and island developing countries would amount to $40,000 (A/C.5/47/29, para. 17).
Upon inquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the expenditure for consultancy as at October 1992 amounted to $78,500 against an appropriation in 1992 of $149,000.
4. The additional requirements for travel to conduct fact-finding missions and consultations with Governments are estimated at $55,000 (ibid., para. 18).
Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that the expenditure for travel as at October 1992 amounted to $256,700 against an appropriation of $274,100 for 1992.
With regard to the above expenditures for consultants and travel during 1992, the Committee was informed that the reorientation of activities from a sectoral to a thematic approach had begun and that a number of anticipated consultancies and missions had been postponed to 1993.
5. The representatives of the Secretary-General stated that it would not be possible to redeploy resources from within section 24 of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 to finance the proposed activities estimated at $95,000 (ibid., para. 21).
Considering that the restructuring of ESCAP is in process and that it is difficult to project any overexpenditure under section 24 at the present time and taking into account the low implementation level under consultancy as well as the extrabudgetary resources available to ESCAP ($37.2 million) for the biennium 1992-1993, the Advisory Committee sees no need for the General Assembly to authorize an additional appropriation of $95,000 at the present time.
The Advisory Committee therefore recommends that, at the present stage, the Fifth Committee take note of the above estimate on the understanding that such additional appropriations as may be necessary would be indicated by the Secretary-General in his first performance report on the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 under section 24.
B. Crime prevention and criminal justice
6. The Secretary-General recalls in paragraph 1 of his report (A/C.5/47/40) that the General Assembly, in its resolution 46/152 of 18 December 1991, took note of the report of the Ministerial Meeting on the Creation of an Effective United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme 3/ and approved the statement of principles and programme of action annexed to its resolution.
7. In paragraph 7 of the same resolution, the General Assembly, requested the Secretary-General to take the necessary action within the overall existing United Nations resources and to provide appropriate resources for the effective functioning of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme in accordance with the principles outlined in the statement of principles and programme of action.
8. With regard to the proposed creation of an effective crime prevention and criminal justice programme (A/C.5/47/40, sect. B), the Advisory Committee notes that the Committee for Programme and Coordination, at the first part of its thirty-second session, recommended to the General Assembly the approval of revisions to programme 29 (Crime prevention and criminal justice) of the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997, with the modifications as stated in paragraph 70 of part one of its report. 1/
9. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 12 of the Secretary-General's report that the upgrading of the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch into a division, as recommended by the General Assembly in its resolution 46/152, annex, paragraph 32, to be headed by a director at the D-2 level, would be given further consideration in the context of the ongoing review of the economic and social sectors.
However, the Secretary-General further states that some strengthening of the staff resources of the Branch in 1993 appears necessary.
10. The Secretary-General estimates that three additional posts (two P-4 and one P-3) would be required to carry out the new tasks of the crime prevention and criminal justice programme, especially in the areas of technical cooperation and expanded operational activities, development of coordinated training programmes and development, maintenance and operation of additional databases (A/C.5/47/40, para. 13).
Furthermore, the Secretary-General estimates additional requirements for outside expertise ($30,000), travel for fact-finding missions and consultations ($15,000) and computer equipment and software ($20,000) (ibid., paras. 14-16).
11. Upon inquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the Secretary-General would redeploy the required additional two P-4 and one P-3 posts (see para. 10 above), on a temporary basis, from section 33 (Administration and management), of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 where vacant posts have been identified for redeployment in 1993.
The Advisory Committee trusts that any such proposed redeployment for 1993 will be submitted to it for approval in accordance with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations.
In paragraph 23 of his report, the Secretary-General states that "the preparation of the programme budget for the next biennium will provide an opportunity for the Secretary-General to review thoroughly the overall post requirements in the crime prevention and criminal justice programme".
12. The Advisory Committee further notes that the Secretary-General proposes to absorb the additional requirements for consultancy, travel and computer equipment totalling $65,000 (see para. 10 above) from within the overall appropriations under section 21 (Social development and humanitarian affairs) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 (ibid., para. 24).
In that connection, the Committee was informed that the Secretary-General intended to reassess the situation and requirements of the crime prevention and criminal justice programme in January 1993.
13. As regards the preparation for the Ninth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (ibid., sect. C), the Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1992/24 of 30 July 1992, requested the Secretary-General to provide the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme with the necessary resources to undertake, in an effective and timely manner, within the overall appropriations of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 and adequate resources for the biennium 1994-1995, the preparatory activities for the Ninth Congress (ibid., para. 17).
The Secretary-General estimates that general temporary assistance equivalent to one P-4 and one General Service (other level) posts would be required, starting in 1993 (ibid., para. 19).
14. The Committee notes that it is the intention of the Secretary-General to utilize the savings in staff resources, equivalent to one P-4 and One General Service post under section 21D, following the reorientation of the crime prevention and criminal justice programme, for the preparatory activities of the Ninth Congress in 1993 (ibid., para. 20).
Additional costs for travel of representatives of the regional commissions are estimated at $25,000 (ibid., para. 21); that amount will be absorbed from resources within sections 23 to 26 of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
Public information activities in 1993 are also expected to be financed from within existing resources (ibid., para. 22).
15. The Committee has no objection to the Secretary-General's proposals to finance the additional requirements for the expansion of the crime prevention and criminal justice programme under section 21D, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46/152 and Economic and Social Council resolutions 1992/22 of 30 July 1992 and 1992/24, from within the overall appropriations of sections 21, 23 to 26 and 33 of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 (see paras. 11-14 above).
C. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia
16. The Secretary-General recalls in paragraph 2 of his report (A/C.5/47/41) that the proposed budget of ESCWA has been prepared at the maintenance level and is based on Baghdad costs.
The Commission, at its sixteenth session, held at Amman from 30 August to 3 September 1992, approved, in its resolution 195 (XVI), the programme of work of its secretariat for the biennium 1992-1993, as amended in the light of observations made thereon by the Technical Committee; those amendments, as presented, do not have any programme budget implications (ibid., para. 3).
17. The Secretary-General states in his report that "it is not possible to determine at the present stage whether the headquarters of the Commission will be transferred to a new location in the course of the current biennium" (ibid., para. 5).
The Committee notes that, at the same time, lower operating costs at the current location, Amman, particularly with regard to salaries and common staff costs, have generated substantial savings.
18. The Secretary-General proposes to reflect the projected savings of $5.6 million for the biennium 1992-1993 in the first performance report on the programme budget for the biennium and to maintain the appropriation approved by the General Assembly under section 27 ($50,381,500) at the present time, taking into account the projected additional commitments in relation to late charges for costs incurred at Baghdad and the possibility of a relocation of ESCWA headquarters towards the end of the current biennium (ibid., para. 5).
19. The Advisory Committee has no objection to the above proposals.

Integrated management information system project - Status
of technological innovations in the United Nations -
Progress report on the optical disk project
[1 December 1992]
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the reports of the Secretary-General on (a) the integrated management information system (IMIS) project (A/C.5/47/27), (b) the status of technological innovations in the United Nations (A/C.5/47/18), and (c) the optical disk project (A/C.5/47/18/Add.1).
The Advisory Committee also had before it the report on an independent evaluation of the IMIS project, conducted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46/185 B of 20 December 1991.
I. REPORT ON AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF THE INTEGRATED
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR THE SECRETARIAT
AND FOURTH PROGRESS REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL
2. In requesting the independent evaluation of IMIS, the General Assembly, in its resolution 46/185 B, stated that its purpose was "to assess the approach and methodology adopted in the development and implementation of the project and to determine whether the project can be expected to provide the benefits outlined in the reports of the Secretary-General and to contribute to a more efficient and effective administrative management of the Organization".
The study, which was conducted during June and July 1992, was prepared by Mr. Colin Wooles, of the Government of Canada, and Mr. Edward B. Bergh from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Sweden.
The Advisory Committee found the study well prepared and very useful; accordingly, in an effort to assist members of the Fifth Committee, the executive summary of the study is annexed to the present report.
3. The Advisory Committee notes that the experts concluded that the chances of a technical success of the IMIS project are very high and that the hardware and software selection and procurement processes have been based on sound management practices.
In that connection, the experts state that the IMIS Steering Committee made the appropriate strategic technology decisions, which freed the Organization from being locked into any one hardware/software supplier or group of suppliers.
The experts also endorsed the phased release schedule for IMIS, which entails five releases of software to be progressively implemented from December 1992 to December 1993.
In the opinion of the experts, such an approach is the only possible course of action; to do otherwise "is to invite disaster and, even more so, is impossible".
4. The Advisory Committee is gratified by the findings of the experts with regard to the project's technical design and implementation strategy.
At the same time, it notes the experts' concerns about the Organization's preparation for and understanding of what is required to implement IMIS and what should be happening at the present time.
5. One such action relates to the transfer of knowledge.
The Advisory Committee notes the experts' conclusion that "the Organization has not yet fully initiated a rigorous process for technical knowledge transfer from the contractor to United Nations staff who will be responsible for maintenance and operation of the IMIS system in January 1993", and that it is necessary "for more United Nations staff to be involved with the project to learn firsthand the technologies and how they are used in the IMIS environment".
In the opinion of the consultants such staff must be identified immediately and provided with the necessary training which is available now and which will become available when the successful hardware supplier is known.
Similarly, training for non-technical users is required.
The experts also indicated that the responsibility for transition management must be passed to each user organizational section, and that, with regard to release 1, this planning activity must be initiated now.
6. In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, the importance of training and the transfer of knowledge cannot be overemphasized since, if not carried out properly, the investment in designing and implementing the system will be compromised.
The Advisory Committee therefore discussed those questions at some length with representatives of the Secretary-General; it also notes that, in his report, the Secretary-General, in addressing the main concerns of the experts, notes that "several activities that were under preparation during the experts' visit have been reviewed in the light of their observations and have since been undertaken by both the Department of Administration and Management and the IMIS team" (A/C.5/47/27, para. 20).
7. The Secretary-General elaborates on those activities in rather general terms in paragraphs 21 to 28 of his report.
In that connection, the Advisory Committee notes the statement that "the United Nations will need to review and strengthen the organizations that traditionally provide technical and application support" (ibid., para. 22).
Accordingly, a task force has been established within the Electronic Services Division with the participation of technical staff from the IMIS team, which is responsible for planning the operations related to the installation and maintenance of IMIS.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the task force reviews the installation and maintenance of the system; it also reviews any problem reported by users to ascertain if it relates to the hardware or to the application.
8. With regard to applications support, a centrally managed applications support organization has been proposed instead of a distribution of such support, as is currently the case with regard to existing systems.
As indicated in the Secretary-General's report, the IMIS Steering Committee is considering various options to implement this recommendation (ibid., para. 26).
9. The Secretary-General states in his report that "the knowledge transfer activities had just started when the independent experts conducted their study" (ibid., para. 28); these include the establishment of a training programme.
In response to inquiries, the Advisory Committee was informed that training courses for programmers and systems analysts had begun; the Committee was provided with a functional listing of those staff members.
With regard to the training of users, representatives of the Secretary-General stated that it had been decided, on the advice of consultants in computer training, to create a training system within the IMIS system through the use of detailed tutorials, which can be updated by the system's support whenever advances/changes are introduced to the system.
10. Representatives of the Secretary-General stressed that the above approach will, in the opinion of the Steering Committee, obviate the need for maintaining a costly training infrastructure once the initial training of users has taken place.
In that connection, the Advisory Committee was informed that an inventory had been taken of staff expected to use the system along with the list of functions to be performed in order to design the necessary training programme.
A training video will also be available, as will the traditional training manual; focal points will also be designated in each office for troubleshooters and to assist other users.
While the creation of such a subsystem will initially entail additional costs, representatives of the Secretary-General stressed that it will result in savings in the longer term.
11. The Committee welcomes such planning; at the same time, it stresses that care must be taken to ensure that, once trained, a staff member is retained in a given office to perform the functions for which he/she has been trained; that is, to the extent possible, such staff should not be initially eligible for assignment to peace-keeping operations or other assignments where their training would not be put to good use.
Upon inquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the training schedule had been synchronized with the release of each software.
The Advisory Committee trusts that this schedule will be adhered to, thereby ensuring that the necessary competent staff will be available as needed.
12. The experts also did an assessment of realizable benefits.
In that connection, they noted that there is no doubt that the qualitative benefits, which have been articulated at length in the progress reports of the Secretary-General, are fully realizable.
In his current report, the Secretary-General provides a detailed list of the major qualitative benefits expected from IMIS (ibid., annex II). The Secretary-General also reiterates that, "with the exception of a very few cases, the benefits, while substantial, cannot be quantified in financial terms owing to their nature and to the fact that they cannot be assigned to specific individual functions or to one specific organizational unit" (ibid., para. 42).
13. In response to inquiries, representatives of the Secretary-General also emphasized that a quantitative analysis of the benefits would be costly at this stage, and that, as stated by the Secretary-General, until the IMIS system is fully implemented, it is not possible "to forecast precisely the actual workload and time that will be spent by each staff member in performing his or her functions with IMIS" (ibid.).
However, after one year of full implementation, a detailed analysis could be performed to identify underutilized resources that could be reassigned (ibid., para. 44).
14. The Advisory Committee appreciates the detailed listing of expected benefits.
It also notes that the experts have concurred that it is not possible to attach precise monetary values on benefit attainment, as the information required to do this is not available.
Notwithstanding that position, the Advisory Committee, while appreciating the difficulties inherent in such a task, remains of the view that some effort could have been made to quantify the benefits which would result from eliminating redundant actions through the introduction of IMIS.
15. The Secretary-General deals with the financial aspects of the project in paragraphs 49 to 80 of his report. "With the definition of the new implementation strategy and further progress of work, it is now possible to reassess the total cost of the project", which is currently estimated at $41,332,900 at current prices or $33,080,000 in constant 1988 dollars (ibid., para. 49).
16. As stated in their report, the experts have "a high level of confidence that the results expected for phase I of IMIS are attainable with a funding level which meets the expenditure projections presented in the present report".
The experts also note that the projected total phase I expenditures are marginally above the budget of $31,593,500 originally requested by the Secretary-General; however, they also consider this fact wholly circumstantial, noting that the setback caused by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) changed the whole technical direction of the project and that the new direction has resulted in lower than expected costs.
At the same time, funds for consultant studies, which the experts consider necessary to the development of IMIS, were significantly underbudgeted; a number of other essential project items, such as user training, data-processing services and supplies, and travel were also either omitted from the initial estimates or underbudgeted.
17. The revised estimate of $41,332,900 for phase I represents an increase of $13,332,900 at current prices (or $5,080,000 at 1988 rates) over the estimate of $28 million approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 43/217 of 21 December 1988 as the cost of phase I of the project.
In table 2 of the Secretary-General's report, the total of $41.3 million is compared by main object of expenditure with a corresponding breakdown of the estimate of $28 million.
As shown therein, and as mentioned in paragraph 16 above, the net increase relates primarily to underbudgeting under contractual/consultant services; on the other hand, savings were realized in respect of hardware and software.
Details of those increases/decreases are contained in the Secretary-General's report (ibid., paras. 57-67).
18. As shown in table 2 of the Secretary-General's report, requirements for contractual services ($25,925,200) reflect an increase of $12,061,700 (at current prices) over the original estimate (at 1988 prices) of $13,863,500; in constant 1988 prices, the increase is $7,405,900. "Not only were the actual market costs of consulting services higher than anticipated, but it also became apparent in the course of the project that a number of additional studies ... would be necessary" (ibid., para. 60).
The Secretary-General also notes that the original estimate included no provision for "out-of-scope work", which is usually included in cost estimates for large projects to allow for changes in organizational policy and user requirements not foreseen during the initial study of the system.
Simply stated, out-of-scope work represents additional work which management has identified as necessary in order to implement IMIS in a way that will fully meet its objectives.
Because the contracts are fixed-price contracts, there must be compensation for any additional work decided upon by management.
19. According to the Secretary-General, for projects of this size it is common to make provision for up to 20 per cent of the initial contract costs for out-of-scope work.
The Advisory Committee inquired as to why such a provision had not been included in the original estimates and was informed that the original estimate had been based on the FAO experience.
20. As shown in table 1 of the Secretary-General's report, an estimated amount of $34,051,400 at current prices will have been expended from the inception of the project to the end of 1993.
This is a cumulative total relating to expenditures in different years and thus to different rates of inflation/exchange.
Requirements for the first six months of 1994 are estimated at $7,281,500 (at current inflation and exchange rates), thus bringing the total to $41,332,900.
21. Based on the approved cost-sharing formula for the project, the regular budget share (65.1 per cent) of the total estimate of $41,332,900 would amount to $26,907,700.
As shown in table 3 of the Secretary-General's report, that amount comprises expenditures totalling $22,167,500 for the period 1989-1993 and $4,740,200 in respect of 1994.
22. While the estimated expenditures for the period 1989-1993 total $22,167,500, regular budget appropriations for the same period amount to $19,579,200; there is a shortfall in 1993 of $2,588,300 (ibid., para. 70).
That being the case, the Secretary-General requests the General Assembly to reconsider its decision on the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 and to restore $2,588,300 out of the reduction approved in its resolution 46/185 B. Furthermore, because the amount now requested is within the level of resources included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993, the Secretary-General believes that restoration of the $2,588,300 should not be considered an additional expenditure falling within the scope of the contingency fund.
23. In considering the Secretary-General's request, the Advisory Committee recalled that the Secretary-General, in his report to the General Assembly at its forty-third session, 1/ proposed that 65.1 per cent of IMIS expenditures be financed from the regular budget, 7.4 per cent from peace-keeping and 27.5 per cent from the special accounts for programme support costs to which are credited overhead income generated by expenditures relating to technical cooperation and to general trust funds, as well as reimbursement for administrative support provided by the Organization to extrabudgetary entities such as the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Children's Fund.
24. As explained by the Secretary-General in the same report, the above formula was based on the distribution of 1986-1987 expenditures between the regular budget, peace-keeping activities (excluding troop payments) and technical cooperation and general trust funds and administrative support provided by the Organization to extrabudgetary entities.
Based on that formula, it was estimated that peace-keeping would finance $2.3 million of the total estimate of $31.6 million submitted by the Secretary-General.
25. In its related report, 2/ the Advisory Committee observed that, in view of the recent and prospective developments that were expected to enlarge the scope and level of peace-keeping activities, the proposed share of the cost of phase I of the IMIS project to be met from peace-keeping activities might be understated.
Similarly, the Committee expressed its view that a greater share of financing the project could be met from the special accounts for programme support costs and from other extrabudgetary resources.
26. In response to inquiries, the Advisory Committee was informed that, thus far, the total appropriations from peace-keeping for the IMIS project amounted to $3.1 million, and that the amount to be provided from peace-keeping is likely to increase.
The Committee was also informed, however, that this increase was likely to be offset by a comparable decrease in the amount foreseen from programme support (extrabudgetary) accounts, thus leaving the regular budget share unchanged.
The Committee requests the Secretary-General to review further the cost-sharing formula and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.
27. The Advisory Committee believes that the implementation of the project should proceed as outlined in the Secretary-General's report.
However, because his request has been submitted in the first year of the biennium, but is based on expenditure projections for the entire biennium, the Committee does not believe at this stage that it is necessary to authorize the restoration of the $2.6 million.
It recommends, therefore, that the General Assembly should defer action on this request.
In the event that the project experiences funding difficulties prior to the forty-eighth session of the Assembly, the Secretary-General should report to the Committee accordingly.
28. As stated in the Secretary-General's report, "an appropriation for the regular budget share of the remaining costs of the project will be requested in the context of the proposed programme budget for 1994-1995" (A/C.5/47/27, para. 73).
In that connection, as noted and as shown in table 3 of the report, the regular budget share of expenditures in 1994 is estimated at $4.7 million.
In response to an inquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the amount of $4.7 million, which relates to the development of the system, does not include the additional requirements for general temporary assistance referred to in paragraph 78 of the report.
As stated therein, those requirements relate to the maintenance of existing systems until they are phased out and the additional workload which will be generated until the end of 1995 because of the need to tune the new system, develop new reports and provide additional support to new users of the system.
The Committee was informed that, in financial terms, those additional requirements would amount to $747,900 in 1993.
At current rates of inflation, the costs for the 1994-1995 biennium are estimated at $808,800; the Committee was informed that the Secretary-General will consider the possibility of meeting those costs through redeployment in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
29. In addition to the above-mentioned general temporary assistance, the Secretary-General states that the hardware and software maintenance costs are estimated at 15 per cent of the estimated purchase costs, or approximately $750,000 a year.
Those costs are also not included in the total estimate of $41.3 million for the development of the project, since they will be incurred after implementation.
As stated in paragraph 75 of the Secretary-General's report, those costs will be partly offset by savings in the costs incurred for the maintenance of hardware for the existing systems; when the existing systems are phased out, it is estimated that the annual savings in maintenance could amount to approximately $611,200.
30. The Advisory Committee notes the Secretary-General's statement that the 15 per cent is a standard formula used for determining maintenance costs, although it is possible that the standardization of the hardware and software may enable the Organization to reduce that percentage to 10 (ibid., para. 74).
In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, every effort should be exerted to do so.
31. The combined estimate for hardware and software amounts to $6.2 million.
In response to inquiries, the Advisory Committee was informed that the maintenance costs relate to all of the hardware, but only some of the software; thus the figure of $750,000 does not represent 15 per cent of $6.2 million.
32. As discussed in the Secretary-General's report (A/C.5/47/18), access to United Nations databases by Member States has become an issue of importance.
In that connection, the Advisory Committee trusts that the IMIS system will also be accessible, it being understood that the necessary measures would be taken to ensure the protection of confidential/private data.
33. As noted in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Secretary-General's report (ibid.), it covers the most significant projects which have been undertaken since last year.
In an attempt to present a comprehensive picture of all new technology projects, it also includes areas of activity not emphasized previously, including information on how computer technology has been used in peace-keeping projects.
Because separate reports were requested by the General Assembly on the status of IMIS and the optical disk projects, those projects are not discussed in detail in the report.
34. As a source of general information, the Advisory Committee found the Secretary-General's report useful and well constructed.
However, bearing in mind that many of the projects mentioned therein have been or will be the subject of separate reports and budgetary proposals, the Committee questions whether the continued production of such a report represents the most efficient use of resources.
It therefore recommends that no future reports of this type be submitted.
III. PROGRESS REPORT ON THE OPTICAL DISK PROJECT
35. The Secretary-General's report (A/C.5/47/18/Add.1), which has been submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46/185 B, describes the implementation of phase I of the project and the proposed activities for phase II, as well as a projection of requirements for phase III in the biennium 1994-1995.
36. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 2 of the report that the implementation of phase I "has proceeded along the lines described in paragraphs 7 to 11 of the report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session (A/C.5/46/26)".
The Secretary-General proposes that, during the remainder of the biennium 1992-1993, the available resources should be concentrated on upgrading the capacity of the system, increasing the number of documents stored on optical disk and, to the extent possible, increasing the number of users with access to the system at Geneva and in New York (ibid., para. 11).
In that connection, the Secretary-General explains in paragraphs 12 and 13 of his report that the allocation of the total resources approved by the Assembly for phase II ($1,564,500) differs from that proposed in paragraph 17 of his previous report. 3/ The Advisory Committee has no objection to this revised allocation.
37. The Secretary-General projects requirements for the biennium 1994-1995 at $5.1 million (A/C.5/47/18/Add.1, para. 16).

ANNEX
Executive summary
1. The General Assembly, in its resolution 46/185 B of 20 December 1991, requested that an independent expert study be conducted on the project for developing and implementing an integrated management information system (IMIS) approved by the Assembly in December 1988 and currently under development.
The study was to be submitted to the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.
2. Accordingly, in order to undertake the study, the Department of Administration and Management sought the assistance of a Panel of experts, which consisted of Mr. Colin Wooles, of the Government of Canada, and Mr. Edward B. Bergh, from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Sweden.
Coordination support was provided by the officer-in-charge of the IMIS project.
The study was conducted during June and July 1992.
3. The findings, conclusions and key recommendations resulting from the study are summarized below and include the key findings of the review, the levels of funding required for completion of the project implementation around the world and the management actions necessary to ensure that IMIS is an organizational success.
4. In 1988, IMIS was perceived to be a project consisting of three phases.
The system which will be delivered and installed at Headquarters by the end of 1993 will perform all of the functions of the planned phase I, plus many of the functions planned for phases II and III. This system is scheduled for implementation at offices away from Headquarters during 1994.
Technical design
5. The chances of a technical success of the project are very high.
The hardware and software selection and procurement processes have been based on sound management practices.
This has resulted in the development of a modern, up-to-date computer system, which provides Headquarters and offices away from Headquarters with effective operational, administrative and management information systems which deploy the latest technologies.
6. The technical design is one which can be used by other organizations in the United Nations system, and all efforts should be made by the General Assembly to ensure that the IMIS base platform is used by those organizations when replacement or upgrading of their existing systems capabilities is required.
The design of the IMIS applications is the result of extensive consultation with users around the world, including other organizations in the United Nations system.
7. The United Nations is well served by the contractor conducting design and implementation of the computer system.
The deliverables are on time, are of the required quality, and meet the vendor performance requirements of the contract.
Funding requirements
8. We have conducted several analyses of expenditures and budget projections, including analyses of variance.
In order to compare expenditures against the Secretary-General's project spending estimates of 1988 and the authorized budget, we have converted current year dollars to 1988 dollars in our analyses.
9. The projected total of phase I expenditures are marginally above the requested budget of 1988.
However, as the General Assembly reduced the requested amount by $3.5 million in 1988 and more recently by a further $4 million in 1991 dollars, the project is significantly over the approved budget level at the present time.
At the end of 1992, it is anticipated that $17.6 million in 1988 constant dollars will have been invested in the project.
A further $16 million in 1988 constant dollars (approximately $20.6 million in 1993 dollars) must be invested to install phase I and some aspects of phases II and III at Headquarters and at all offices away from Headquarters.
10. Of the funds required after 1992 to complete the development and installation of phase I, approximately $12.1 million is required in 1993 to install the New York operational database and the corporate database capability.
Approximately $8.5 million will be required in 1993 and 1994 to install IMIS at the offices away from Headquarters during 1994.
Implementation schedule
11. The IMIS Steering Committee has adopted a phased release schedule for IMIS which entails five releases of software to be progressively implemented from December 1992 to December 1993.
It is a realistic approach to schedule a phased implementation during 1993.
We concur that such a phased implementation is the only possible course of action the United Nations can take.
To try to implement all components of a complex integrated system such as IMIS at a single point of time is to invite disaster and, even more so, is impossible.
Benefits of IMIS
12. The qualitative benefits anticipated from IMIS have been articulated at length in the progress reports of the Secretary-General and we are of the view that those benefits are fully realizable.
We also concur that it is not possible to attach precise monetary values on benefit attainment as the information required to do this is not available.
13. We conclude that, above all, IMIS is a strategic positioning instrument for the Secretariat which is aligned with the reform process.
During our review, we have noted examples of policy, strategy, approach and organizational direction which is in line with the directions which many Governments are actively pursuing in enhancing services through the innovative use of information and technology.
We suggest that the assessment of the benefits generated by IMIS should be made in that context.
14. IMIS is a business imperative in the environment of the United Nations, where business levels are at an all time high around the world and where the current information systems are often antiquated and systems are lacking in the capabilities required to support responsively operations and to provide the best levels of information to management.
In essence, IMIS will assist in positioning the United Nations to meet its future responsibilities.
It is a tool for both Headquarters and overseas duty stations which has the potential to be used by many more organizations in the United Nations system.
Organizational readiness: actions required
15. Major changes are occurring in the ownership and management of United Nations data and systems which are precipitated by the design philosophy and concepts of IMIS.
Such changes and their possible organizational impacts and ramifications do not appear, to the Panel, to be realized or understood.
Those changes must be managed.
Transition management
16. Transition management involves user training, conversion of automated and manual files to the IMIS database and possibly temporary bridging to other application systems.
The IMIS project team has developed, in detail, strategies for implementation for each release.
The responsibility for transition management must be passed to each user organizational section.
The head of each unit must be empowered to work with the project team to develop a transition plan for that unit which sets forth in detail the activities to be performed, a timetable, and the resources required and assigned to effect a successful transition to IMIS for the organizational unit.
This planning activity must be initiated now for release 1.
Acceptance testing
17. Unit heads must by necessity be involved in the acceptance testing of the IMIS system and the file conversion and bridging programmes.
That level of involvement in testing, with the concentrated participation of the staff who will be using IMIS, is the only way that senior officials can attain a reasonable assurance that IMIS, as delivered, is processing according to specifications.
The unit heads must be held accountable for independently testing the functionality for which they are responsible and for advising senior officials on the extent and results of the testing.
In order to do this, unit heads must be empowered to work with the project team and the contractor to negotiate and/or devise adequate testing plans for their areas of responsibility.
18. Within the IMIS project team it is necessary to set up an acceptance testing unit, which could be aligned with the quality assurance function.
A test database must be constructed which can be used for progressively testing new releases and, in the future, for testing enhancements to IMIS.
Information services organization
19. With the move towards integrated data systems and consistent technologies on a global basis, there is a need for a retrenchment of control of information resource management to a central coordinating unit.
In strategic information planning parlance, this has, in many circles, been known as the Chief Information Officer concept.
The United Nations should consider this type of organization, in conjunction with the Electronic Services Division, to house the future management of IMIS.
Knowledge transfer
20. Staff members who will be involved in all computer operations and software library and maintenance aspects of IMIS must be identified immediately, and provided with the necessary training which is available now and that which will become available when the successful hardware supplier is known.
To assure effective knowledge transfer from the contractor specialists to the identified operations and programming personnel, arrangements should be made for those persons to work with the project team, specifically with the contractor staff, until the system is handed over to the United Nations for production.
21. Similarly, key members of user units, who will in the future be authorized to access the IMIS database and download data or generate their own reports, may also find it beneficial to take the opportunity of engaging in knowledge transfer from the contractor specialists.
Backup and recovery
22. The contractor will be producing recommendations for backup and disaster recovery and other contingency plans as one of the deliverables under the Computer System Design contract.
Those plans must also be subjected to acceptance testing.
Contingency procedures should be tested regularly in the production environment.
Contingency and recovery plans and procedures must be agreed to by the user community, which must also be involved in their testing.
Policy decisions
23. Computer coding is about to commence and this activity has a finite schedule.
Where subject-matter policy decisions are required on how the computer programmes are to compute and/or process, they should be made expeditiously so that the IMIS programming schedule is not jeopardized.

Proposed programme budget outline for the biennium 1994-1995 -
Prototype of a new budget format - Procedures and norms for the
creation, suppression, reclassification, conversion and
redeployment of posts - Extrabudgetary resources of the
United Nations
[7 December 1992]
Proposed programme budget outline for the biennium 1994-1995
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed programme budget outline for the biennium 1994-1995 (A/47/358).
During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee was provided with additional information by representatives of the Secretary-General.
2. Introductory and background material is provided in paragraphs 1 to 3 of the Secretary-General's report.
The Secretary-General states in paragraph 3 of his report that the proposed outline for the biennium 1994-1995 relates to a biennium that will reflect fully the effects of the restructuring of the Secretariat undertaken in the course of 1992.
3. Furthermore, the outline reflects the changes in the preparation of the programme budget that are being proposed in the report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session under the terms of section VIII of General Assembly resolution 46/185 B of 20 December 1991 (A/C.5/47/3).
The methodology has been simplified and the outline does not involve a complex revaluation of the resource base nor does it reflect a specific treatment of non-recurrent items for the calculation of growth.
The Advisory Committee has been informed that, in the best judgement of the Secretary-General, the related costs, at initial 1992-1993 rates, are now estimated at $21.2 million ($17.7 million for regular expenditure and $3.5 million in capital expenditure).
5. Of this total, $16.8 million has already been anticipated in the Secretary-General's preliminary estimate.
In keeping with past practice, it would be necessary to add $4.4 million to the preliminary estimate.
6. As indicated in paragraph 5 of the Secretary-General's report (A/47/358), budgetary growth is projected at $4 million.
This is the net result of a number of factors, which are explained in paragraph 6 of the report.
7. In paragraph 6 (a) of the Secretary-General's report (ibid.) a number of additional requirements are mentioned; among them is an amount of $28 million for preventive diplomacy and peacemaking missions.
The Advisory Committee believes that by their very nature those activities are generally unpredictable.
The experience gained in one biennium is not necessarily an indication of what will be encountered in the next.
Furthermore, the Advisory Committee believes that the General Assembly, in its resolution 46/187 of 20 December 1991 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses, adequately provides for any unexpected activity.
The Advisory Committee therefore recommends that provision for such activities should not be included in the outline for the biennium 1994-1995.
8. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee recalls the provision in paragraph 10 of annex I to General Assembly resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986 that "a comprehensive solution to the problem of all additional expenditures, including those deriving from inflation and currency fluctuation, is also necessary".
The Advisory Committee therefore requests the Secretary-General to refine further his proposal for the treatment of estimates for preventive diplomacy and peacemaking by defining the nature of those estimates and stating to what extent they are predictably recurrent, and by proposing a methodology for the treatment of such estimates both in future outlines and in proposed programme budgets.
The Secretary-General's analysis in that regard should be available to the Advisory Committee by the spring of 1993.
9. Paragraph 6 (a) of the Secretary-General's report also refer to an amount of $99.5 million for capital expenditure.
Although that amount is at the level of the projected revised appropriation for the biennium 1992-1993, the Advisory Committee nevertheless intends to monitor developments in that regard in the context of its examination of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
10. The Advisory Committee was informed that for the purpose of these estimates the vacancy rate for posts in the Professional category was calculated at 5 per cent and for posts in the General Service category at 0.5 per cent.
However, more recent information provided indicates the vacancy rate for posts in the General Service category at 1.4 per cent.
The Advisory Committee intends to pay particular attention to the vacancy rate when it examines the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
11. Taking into account paragraphs 4, 5 and 7 above, the total preliminary estimate recommended by the Advisory Committee at initial 1992-1993 rates is $2,386.4 million.
12. In keeping with past practice, it is also necessary to take into account updated forecasts for inflation for the next biennium and the latest available rates of exchange.
According to information provided by the Secretary-General, adjustment to revised 1992-1993 rates would require an addition of $53.7 million.
The subsequent adjustment to 1994-1995 rates would require a further addition of $262.6 million.
13. As shown in the table below, the total preliminary estimate recommended by the Advisory Committee for the biennium 1994-1995 corresponds to $2,702.7 million at 1994-1995 rates as currently projected by the Secretary-General:
Millions of United States dollars
1. Secretary-General's preliminary estimate
at initial 1992-1993 rates 2 410.0
2. Recommendations of the Advisory Committee
on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (23.6)
3. Adjustment due to recosting at revised
1992-1993 rates 53.7
4. Adjustment due to recosting at 1994-1995 rates 262.6
Total 2 702.7
14. The size of the contingency fund is discussed in paragraph 13 of the Secretary-General's report.
As has been the practice during the past two bienniums, the size of the contingency fund as a percentage of the overall level of resources has been approved at 0.75 per cent.
For the biennium 1990-1991, the level of the fund in United States dollars amounted to $15 million, of which approximately $3.2 million remained available at the close of the biennium.
For the biennium 1992-1993, the dollar amount of the fund was set at $18 million while the available balance following decisions of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session is $15.2 million.
The Secretary-General therefore recommends that the level of the fund be maintained at 0.75 per cent of the overall level of resources for the biennium 1994-1995, amounting to approximately $20 million.
The Advisory Committee concurs in that recommendation.
Prototype of a new budget format
15. The Advisory Committee has also considered the report of the Secretary-General on the prototype of a new budget format (A/C.5/47/3).
The Committee welcomes the changes, which, it believes, will greatly simplify the budget document, and intends to comment on them in greater detail and in particular on changes in methodology when it examines the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
16. While noting the proposals made by the Secretary-General, the Advisory Committee requests that he ensure that part I of the new proposed programme budget is clear and concise.
In other words, as outlined in paragraphs 5 and 6 of his report, that part of the new budget document should provide an overview rather than technical information, with a limited number of tabular annexes.
17. In that connection, the Advisory Committee suggests that the annexes to both parts of the new document as currently proposed be re-examined with a view not only to simplifying the annexes but also, particularly as regards part II of the document, to determining which annexes should be retained.
In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, some of the annexes as envisaged may prove to be too technical for the general user and/or superfluous; some of them could be provided separately for the use of the Advisory Committee and the Committee for Programme and Coordination.
18. The Advisory Committee notes the proposals in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the report with regard to the relationship between sections, departments and major programmes of the medium-term plan.
The Committee points out that a balance must be struck in the volume of resources to be administered by programme managers between the flexibility required by the Secretary-General and the need for adequate legislative scrutiny and control.
It should also be borne in mind that it is difficult to administer a budget that fails to correspond to the structure of the Secretariat.
The Committee will scrutinize the Secretary-General's presentation in the context of its examination of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
19. The Advisory Committee trusts that the new budget document will contain consistent treatment of estimates for policy-making organs and executive direction and management.
The aim should be to ensure comparability of estimates for those activities between sections.
Procedures and norms for the creation, suppression, reclassification, conversion and redeployment of posts
20. In considering the note submitted by the Secretary-General with regard to the procedures and norms for the creation, suppression, reclassification, conversion and redeployment of posts (A/C.5/47/4), the Advisory Committee recognizes that the document is a preliminary response to General Assembly resolution 46/185 B, section II; it summarizes the existing procedures for changes in the staffing table and suggests possible directions for improvement.
21. As described in various parts of the document, the Advisory Committee notes the constraints in the establishment and application of uniform workload standards for determining the relative grading of functions within the Organization.
The Committee notes from paragraph 10 of the document that so far workload standards have only been established and applied to language services in the Office of Conference Services and that there are significant constraints to extending those techniques to other areas of work.
However, the Committee was informed that the results of an internal survey on the subject indicate that there may be a possibility of establishing workload standards for procurement activities.
The Committee welcomes this prospect and believes that, to the extent possible, activities that can be quantified should be included in the exercise; this should not preclude qualitative reviews.
22. In paragraph 14 of his note, the Secretary-General indicates that "ideas such as the possibility of integrating levels P-2 to P-4 for budgetary purposes or budgeting staff in terms of work-months, could also rationalize and expedite the consideration of staffing table proposals".
In other words, the Secretary-General proposes to budget Professional posts at levels P-2 to P-4 at a single level in the same manner as G-1 to G-6 posts are budgeted for as a group.
23. The Secretary-General indicates that that proposal, while not undermining the integrity of the classification system, will simplify budgetary procedures and increase managerial flexibility in the management of posts.
As mentioned in paragraph 37 of his report on career development at the United Nations (A/C.5/47/6), which the Committee had before it, the Secretary-General also cautions that in order to ensure that an appropriate spread of staff at the P-2 to P-4 levels would continue to exist, maximum percentages for each level would be established for each office or department.
Those levels would be used with flexibility within the established limits with the understanding that posts used at a higher level than the classified one would revert to their classified level after the incumbents concerned moved.
The Advisory Committee does not object to the basic idea advanced by the Secretary-General.
However, subject to any decision that the General Assembly may wish to take in the context of its agenda item on personnel questions, the Advisory Committee recommends, at this stage, for budgetary purposes, that that integration be instituted in two parts, namely levels P-1 and P-2, and P-3 and P-4.
Extrabudgetary resources of the United Nations
24. The Advisory Committee also considered two reports of the Secretary-General 1/ regarding extrabudgetary resources of the United Nations and related activities.
Given that those reports had been submitted to the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session but could not be considered at that time, the Committee believes that some of the information contained in the reports is outdated.
The Committee will therefore confine its comments to certain basic elements contained in the reports, pending receipt of updated information in due course.
25. The report on the extrabudgetary resources of the United Nations 2/ provides more in the way of information than proposals whether for better use of and planning of the need for extrabudgetary resources or for more scrutiny and control in that area of expenditure.
Likewise, the question of the impact of extrabudgetary resources on programme priorities remains unclear.
In that regard, the Advisory Committee notes the ongoing discussions on the subject in the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the General Assembly.
26. It is obvious from the report that there is a wide range of extrabudgetary funds.
The Advisory Committee has, over the years, signalled its intent to become much more closely involved in the examination of those funds.
27. The Advisory Committee therefore appreciates the proposals outlined in paragraphs 57 to 64 of the report, 2/ which would not only contribute to an improvement in forecasting of extrabudgetary resources but also improve transparency in presentation in the context of the new budget format with regard to extrabudgetary resources.
28. With regard to the issue of special-purpose contributions discussed in paragraphs 37 to 39 of the report, 2/ the Advisory Committee believes that where donors attach conditions that are contrary to United Nations policy, the Organization's regulations and rules shall prevail.
The Committee has expressed its views on the subject in the past, and most recently in its comments (A/47/500, para. 152) on the report of the Board of Auditors 3/ relating to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in which it stated:
"As to the acceptance of a contribution by UNHCR with an unfavourable clause, the Committee reiterates the Board's recommendation, ... that UNHCR is obliged to ensure that voluntary contributions are accepted and utilized in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Financial Regulations of the United Nations, the financial rules for voluntary funds, and, where applicable, United Nations Staff Regulations and Staff Rules."
United Nations office accommodation: reimbursement to the regular budget of the cost of accommodation for posts related to extrabudgetary activities
29. From the report of the Secretary-General, 4/ the Advisory Committee notes that the regular budget of the United Nations bears a large portion of the cost of accommodation in respect of staff charged against extrabudgetary resources.
The current situation with regard to the reimbursement to the regular budget of the cost of accommodation is outlined in paragraphs 10 to 28 of the report and recommendations in that regard are outlined in paragraphs 32 to 39.
The Advisory Committee notes, however, that the information provided to it in the report is incomplete.
As stated in paragraph 29 of the report with regard to collection of data on current occupancy of accommodation by regular budget and extrabudgetary staff, "not all data have been collected".
30. With regard to the recommendations contained in the document, related cost estimates have not been made available to the Advisory Committee on the basis of which it could make detailed comments.
However, the report was prepared for the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session and needs to be updated.
The Committee believes, however, that the principle of burden sharing should be maintained.
While the Committee agrees with the proposal made in paragraph 32 of the document, that is, that rental be charged to specialized agencies, the Committee believes that the benefits to be obtained from charging rental from subsidiary programmes as outlined in paragraph 33 of the report are not obvious.
The Committee intends to make more detailed comments and recommendations on the subject and to that end requests that an updated and thorough analysis of the situation be submitted to it so that it can be considered at the time it takes up the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.

Eleventh report
Comprehensive study of the question of honoraria payable
to members of organs and subsidiary organs of the
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the Secretary-General's report on the question of honoraria payable to members of organs and subsidiary organs of the United Nations (A/C.5/47/45).
During the course of its consideration of the document, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General.
2. The Advisory Committee recalls that by its ninth report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 1/ it noted the Secretary-General's intention to conduct, inter alia, a comprehensive review of the question of honoraria payable to members of organs and subsidiary organs of the United Nations and to submit a report thereon with appropriate proposals to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session.
3. The Committee also recalls that, in its resolution 35/218 of 17 December 1980, the General Assembly decided to set the rates applicable for the payment of honoraria, with effect from 1 January 1981, to members of the International Law Commission, the International Narcotics Control Board, the United Nations Administrative Tribunal and the Human Rights Committee, bodies which the Assembly had earlier decided should receive honoraria on an exceptional basis.
Those rates are reflected in paragraph 1 of the Secretary-General's report.
4. By its resolution 36/240 of 18 December 1981, the General Assembly decided that the members of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women would be paid the rate of honoraria set out in its resolution 35/218 and also decided, in its resolution 44/201 A of 21 December 1989, that honoraria for members of the Committee on the Rights of the Child would also be payable at the rates authorized in resolution 35/218.
5. The Advisory Committee was informed by representatives of the Secretary-General that the members of those six bodies currently receiving honoraria also received travel and subsistence allowance at the standard rates plus 40 per cent, as outlined in ST/SGB/107/Rev.6; thus honoraria are in addition to the conditions of service that apply to expert bodies generally.
6. For the reasons given in his report, the Secretary-General proposes to increase the existing rates of honoraria by 25 per cent.
The revised rates payable to members of those six bodies which the General Assembly had already authorized on an exceptional basis would be as follows:
Rate of honoraria
(United States dollars)
Present Proposed
rate a/ rate Increase
Chairmen (presidents) 5 000 6 250 1 250
Vice-Chairmen of the
Control Board 4 000 5 000 1 000
Other members 3 000 3 750 750
Additional amount payable to
members of the International Law Commission, when acting
as special rapporteurs,
conditional upon the preparation of specific
reports or studies between
sessions of the Commission 2 500 3 125 625
a/ As authorized by the General Assembly in its resolutions 35/218, 36/240 and 44/201 A.
7. The Advisory Committee will not object to that proposal.
That being said, there is little evidence in the report to suggest that a comprehensive review regarding such questions as whether there might be other bodies within the system eligible for payment of honoraria, or the implications of introducing uniformity into the conditions for the payment of honoraria, has been carried out.
8. Should the General Assembly decide to revise the rates of honoraria as outlined above, effective 1 January 1993, the financial implications for 1993 have been estimated at $86,625 (ibid., para. 16 and annex I). The Advisory Committee was informed that that estimate had been calculated at full cost and did not take into account payments for actual attendance.
9. In paragraph 54 of his report, the Secretary-General states that depending on the guidance that the General Assembly might provide during its current session on the relationship between workload and payment of honoraria to members of organs of the United Nations, it might be necessary to revert to the question at a later date.
10. The report of the Secretary-General indicates that the proposed honoraria would also be applicable to members of the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families upon entry into force of the International Convention adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 45/158 of 18 December 1990.
Under the terms of article 72, paragraph 8, of the Convention, the members of the Committee shall receive emoluments from United Nations resources on such terms and conditions as the General Assembly may decide.
11. In paragraph 85 of its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993, 2/ the Advisory Committee stated that with the rapid expansion of the activities of the United Nations in certain areas, the work of some of its committees and commissions had increased dramatically, and expressed its belief that the time had come for the Secretary-General to examine all of the consequences of that trend and to report thereon to the General Assembly with such recommendations as might be appropriate.
12. In section VII of its resolution 46/185 B of 20 December 1991, the General Assembly endorsed that statement, which was not directly related to the question of payment of honoraria but reflected views on the increase in the general workload of various committees and commissions.
13. The Advisory Committee does not believe that the concerns expressed in paragraph 85 of its report mentioned in paragraph 11 above and endorsed by the General Assembly have been adequately addressed in the report of the Secretary-General.
As for the proposal contained in paragraphs 54 and 55 of the report of the Secretary-General, the Advisory Committee refrains from comment, since it involves the Committee itself; the Advisory Committee transmits that proposal for appropriate action by the Assembly.
Should the Assembly approve the Secretary-General's recommendation contained in paragraphs 54 and 55 of his report, the estimated financial implication for 1993 would be $46,000.

Twelfth report
Programme budget implications of the proposals submitted by the
First Committee in the following documents: A/47/689 (draft
resolution), A/47/691 (draft resolution E), A/47/692 (draft
(draft resolution)
(Agenda items 59, 61 (l), 62 (b), 63 and 68)*
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered five statements of programme budget implications relating to disarmament as contained in documents A/C.5/47/50, A/C.5/47/52, A/C.5/47/63, A/C.5/47/64 and A/C.5/47/65.
2. As stated in document A/C.5/47/63, the draft decision submitted by the First Committee in document A/47/693, paragraph 28, calls for the reconvening of the First Committee for five working days in March 1993 and involves the provision of conference servicing at an estimated full cost of $815,900.
3. The draft resolution submitted by the First Committee in document A/47/698, paragraph 9, relates, inter alia, to the holding of a session of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean in 1993.
As shown in document A/C.5/47/52, this would entail conference servicing at an estimated full cost of $454,000.
* Implementation of the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa [item 59].
General and complete disarmament: transparency in armaments [item 61 (l)].
Review and implementation of the Concluding Document of the Twelfth Special Session of the General Assembly: regional confidence-building measures [item 62 (b)].
Review of the implementation of the recommendations and decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its tenth special session [item 63].
Implementation of the Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [item 68].
will be considered in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
6. The activities called for in 1993 relate to the operation and maintenance of the Register of Conventional Arms, as discussed in paragraphs 9 and 10 of document A/C.5/47/50.
In paragraph 11 of the same document, the Secretary-General estimates the related additional requirements at $171,300 at full cost, comprising $50,000 for the acquisition of computer hardware and software for system development (start-up costs) and $121,300 for the salary and common staff costs of three additional posts, that is, two Professional and one General Service.
7. However, the Secretary-General further states that, in respect of the staff requirements, in 1993 only one Professional and the General Service staff member would be required and that the Professional post would be redeployed from elsewhere in keeping with the new treatment of vacancies as discussed in his report (A/C.5/47/2 and Corr.1).
8. Consequently, should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution E, the Secretary-General concludes that additional requirements totalling $79,500 would arise under section 37 (Department of Political Affairs), comprising $29,500 in general temporary assistance to finance one General Service staff member and $50,000 for the computer hardware and software for system development and testing.
9. The Advisory Committee is not convinced that an additional appropriation is required at the present stage to cover the computer hardware and software for system development and testing; additional requirements could be reported in the context of the performance report.
Nor is the Committee convinced that the amount of $29,500 for general temporary assistance cannot be absorbed from within the overall resources for general temporary assistance provided for disarmament activities under section 37.
It therefore recommends that, should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution E, no additional appropriations be approved under section 37.
10. As stated in document A/C.5/47/64, in draft resolution A submitted by the First Committee in document A/47/692, paragraph 25, the General Assembly would, inter alia, request the Secretary-General to continue to provide assistance to the Central African States in implementing the programme of work of the Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa of the Economic Community of Central African States.
In that connection, the Secretary-General states in paragraph 8 of document A/C.5/47/64 that it is understood that the intent of the sponsors of the draft resolution was that that assistance would be provided through the convening of two meetings of the Standing Advisory Committee in 1993 and that all relevant costs of convening and holding the meetings would have to be borne by the regular budget of the United Nations.
The Secretary-General also states his understanding that the United Nations would not be requested to provide conference services and that the meetings of the Standing Advisory Committee would not be included in the calendar of conferences and meetings for 1993.
11. The combined costs of the two meetings, which are expected to be held at Bujumbura and Libreville total $203,200.
That amount includes $29,500 in conference-servicing costs to cover the rental of conference rooms, interpretation and rental of office equipment.
The total of $203,200 also includes provision for the payment of travel and subsistence for governmental representatives.
In that connection, the Secretary-General states in paragraph 10 that the payment of travel and subsistence costs to governmental representatives at the meetings would require an exception to the general principle that only members of United Nations organs or subsidiary organs serving in their individual capacities should receive such reimbursements.
While the meetings in question do not relate to an organ or subsidiary organ of the United Nations, the Advisory Committee was informed that that principle was extended to other meetings convened by the United Nations.
12. As recalled by the Secretary-General, the ministerial-level organizational meeting of the Standing Advisory Committee was convened by the Secretary-General in 1992 pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46/37 B of 6 December 1991.
The First Committee had previously been informed that the related requirements of that meeting would be approximately $90,000, to be financed from extrabudgetary resources.
Accordingly, no appropriation had been requested at the forty-sixth session of the Assembly.
13. The estimate of $90,000 also included provision for the travel and subsistence of governmental representatives; in response to inquiries, representatives of the Secretary-General acknowledged that authorization to effect the payment as an exception to the prevailing principle governing such payments should have been sought.
14. Such authority has been sought in relation to the current draft resolution.
However, the Advisory Committee would wish to bring to the attention of the Fifth Committee that the Secretary-General, pursuant to General Assembly decision 46/450 of 20 December 1991, has submitted a review of travel and related entitlements for members of organs and subsidiary organs and staff members of the United Nations, as contained in document A/C.5/47/61 and Corr.1.
That report has yet to be considered by the Advisory Committee and the Fifth Committee.
The Advisory Committee is of the view that until that report is considered, the Fifth Committee may wish to defer action on granting the exception for the payment of travel and subsistence to the governmental representatives to the two meetings of the Standing Advisory Committee.
15. The Advisory Committee is also of the view that renewed efforts should be made to secure some financial input from the host Governments for the provision of conference services, particularly since it involves local expenditures.
16. In the circumstances, the Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform the General Assembly that, should it adopt draft resolution A in document A/47/692, no additional appropriation should be approved at the present stage under section 37 of the programme budget and that no exception to pay for travel and subsistence costs of government representatives should be granted at the present stage.
17. As outlined in document A/C.5/47/65, in the draft resolution submitted by the First Committee in document A/47/689, paragraph 9, the General Assembly would request the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to take appropriate action to enable the group of experts designated by the United Nations in cooperation with OAU to meet during 1993 at Harare to draw up a draft treaty or convention on the denuclearization of Africa.
18. In that connection, the Secretary-General states his understanding that the United Nations would not be requested to provide conference services and that the meeting of experts would not be included in the calendar of conferences and meetings for 1993.
However, the regular budget of the United Nations would bear all costs related to the convening of the meeting.
Those costs are estimated at $72,300, as outlined in paragraph 7 of document A/C.5/47/65, and include $13,600 in conference-servicing costs for the rental of the conference room, interpretation, the rental of office equipment and translation.
19. In keeping with its recommendation regarding the draft resolution in document A/47/692, the Advisory Committee believes that an effort should be made for the host Government to bear the conference-servicing costs.
With regard to the substantive costs, which are estimated at $58,700, it recommends that an effort be made to absorb them within existing appropriations under section 37 and that the Secretary-General report accordingly in the context of the performance report.
20. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommends that, should the draft resolution in document A/47/689 be adopted, no additional appropriations be authorized under section 37 of the programme budget at the present stage.

Thirteenth report
Programme budget implications of the draft resolution
submitted by the Third Committee in document A/47/678
[8 December 1992]
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the statement (A/C.5/47/55), submitted by the Secretary-General in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, on the programme budget implications of the draft resolution submitted by the Third Committee in document A/47/678, paragraph 8.
The draft resolution relates to human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
During its consideration of the statement, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General who provided additional information.
2. Should the General Assembly adopt the draft resolution, the Secretary-General would establish the United Nations Observer Mission to Verify the Referendum in Eritrea (UNOVER) under the terms of reference outlined in paragraph 4 of his statement of programme budget implications.
3. On the basis of the assumptions outlined in paragraphs 4 to 19 of the statement, the Secretary-General estimates that an additional appropriation of $2,577,000 would be required under section 2 (Peace-keeping operations and special missions) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
An amount of $184,000 would also be required under section 36 (Staff assessment), offset by the same amount under income section 1 (Income from staff assessment).
Also, according to the Secretary-General, the General Assembly would need to authorize him to enter into commitments of up to $103,000 for that portion of the additional requirements which would be needed in 1992, pending the Assembly's approval of revised appropriations for the biennium 1992-1993.
4. As reflected in paragraph 15 of the Secretary-General's statement, $1,672,000 relates to personnel costs such as salaries, fees, travel and related allowances, including a contingency provision for death and disability claims for any international observers not covered by the relevant United Nations staff rules.
The balance, $905,000, would provide for operational costs such as rental of premises, rental and acquisition of vehicles, and communications equipment and rental of aircraft.
The Advisory Committee notes from the tabular summary in paragraph 15 that, of the total requirements of $2,577,000, an amount of $103,000 has been reflected against 1992 while an amount of $2,474,000 has been shown for 1993.
5. As outlined in annex I to the statement, the requirements for personnel include, for periods ranging from approximately 2 to 22 weeks, the provision of * Human rights questions: human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 22 core posts (1 ASG, 2 P-5, 2 P-4, 3 P-3/4, 1 P-3, 10 P-2/3, 2 Field Service and 1 General Service) in addition to 123 staff under general temporary assistance and 100 election monitors.
6. In respect of other requirements listed in annex II to the statement, provision has been made for items such as the rental of premises to accommodate UNOVER headquarters and three regional offices; the acquisition of nine vehicles for the duration of the operation and rental of additional vehicles for varying lengths of time; the rental of aircraft for observer teams and medical evacuations if required; the acquisition of communications and various other equipment and supplies, and freight and cartage.
As described in paragraph 13 of the statement and in item 8 of annex II, public information activities are estimated at $42,000.
7. Notwithstanding the reasons given in the statement of programme budget implications, including the indication in paragraph 8 that efforts will be made to fill the 10 P-2/3 posts by United Nations Volunteers, the Advisory Committee believes that the number and level of core staff should be reduced and some of the functions of these staff combined.
Furthermore, estimates for personnel costs have been calculated at full cost and the Committee believes that there is a possibility for savings to be realized under such items as travel, common staff costs and compensation for death and disability.
8. The Advisory Committee observes that "no commitment has been made by the provisional government to provide office accommodation" (A/C.5/47/55, para. 11).
The Committee believes that, pursuant to the Secretary-General's further negotiations with the provisional government, support should be obtained to the extent possible, in the form of office accommodation, local staff, including drivers and interpreters, vehicles and possibly even aircraft.
Considerable savings could thus be realized against those items of expenditure.
9. The Advisory Committee notes that assistance and input from specialized agencies and other United Nations bodies has not been mentioned in the statement.
The possibility of this should be vigorously pursued.
In addition, the Committee believes that there is room for absorption of the requirements for public information activities within the provisions for the Department of Public Information.
10. On the basis of the considerations mentioned above and bearing in mind that the mission might not start on the proposed date, the Advisory Committee believes that a reduction in the Secretary-General's estimate from $2,577,000 to $2 million should be made.
Furthermore, with regard to the mode of financing of UNOVER, the Committee notes from paragraph 18 of the statement that the Secretary-General has made an appeal to Member States for voluntary contributions to fund UNOVER through the United Nations Trust Fund for Electoral Observation, established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46/137 of 17 December 1991.
The Committee was informed that the appeal was launched only on 2 November 1992; thus it is still too early to determine the success of this effort.
11. The Advisory Committee, therefore, does not agree with the Secretary-General's proposal that the requirements for UNOVER should be dealt with in the manner proposed in paragraphs 20 and 21 of his statement.
However, under the terms of the draft resolution, the Secretary-General would be authorized to establish UNOVER and requested to arrange for the deployment of the Mission as soon as possible.
In view of this fact and taking into account paragraph 10 above, the Advisory Committee recommends that, if the Secretary-General is authorized by the General Assembly to commence operations, the related commitments be treated as an advance from the Working Capital Fund, with the understanding that the commitments would be a first charge against contributions received pursuant to resolution 46/137 and the Secretary-General's appeal dated 2 November 1992.
On this basis, the Advisory Committee recommends that the Secretary-General be authorized to enter into commitments not exceeding $2 million pending receipt of voluntary contributions for this operation.

Fourteenth report
Revised estimates under section 37 (Department of Political Affairs)
[9 March 1993]
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General concerning the United Nations regional centres for Peace and Disarmament in Africa and in Asia and the Pacific and the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean (A/C.5/47/62).
2. The report of the Secretary-General, submitted pursuant to a recommendation of the Advisory Committee in paragraph 17 of its twelfth report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993, 1/ states that an additional appropriation of $300,000 would be required for 1993 under section 37 (Department of Political Affairs) to cover the estimated 1993 administrative costs of the above-mentioned three centres.
It is recalled that in its resolution 46/37 F of 9 December 1991, the General Assembly decided that the administrative costs of the centres should be financed from the regular budget.
In connection with the adoption of that resolution, as stated in paragraph 3 of the report of the Secretary-General, the Fifth Committee, at its 46th meeting on 7 December 1991:
"decided to inform the General Assembly that the adoption of the resolution might require up to $600,000 [for 1992-1993] and that the actual additional appropriation would be reviewed as soon as possible during the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly.
The Committee also informed the Assembly in its report 1/ that, bearing in mind the comments and observations of ACABQ and all the views expressed in the Fifth Committee, it would review the matter further in the light of the report to be submitted by the Secretary-General.
"1/ A/46/752, para. 6." 2/
4. The Advisory Committee recalls that in paragraphs 10, 11 and 15 of its twelfth report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993, 1/ it made a number of observations concerning the financing of the centres.
Without prejudice to those observations, the Advisory Committee went on to recommend that should the Assembly adopt the draft resolution, the Fifth Committee and the Advisory Committee, bearing in mind their respective responsibilities, would advise the Assembly as to the actual level of administrative support.
Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommended, in paragraph 17 of its twelfth report mentioned above, that the Secretary-General submit a detailed report "providing, inter alia, a full disclosure of the financial position of each centre, with supporting documentation, the proposed programme of work and a functional breakdown of all staff, whether administrative or operational".
5. The Advisory Committee regrets the late submission of the report.
It also is of the view that, as briefly summarized in the paragraphs below, the report falls short in providing accurate information on the level of programmes funded through voluntary contributions.
Such information would enable the Committee to determine the appropriate level of administrative support.
6. The report of the Secretary-General provides the programme of activities for 1992 for each centre and that proposed for 1993; however, no indication of the estimated cost of the activities is included in the report.
Although annexes IV, VII and XI provide information regarding pledges for 1992, the lack of information concerning programme costs makes it difficult to ascertain whether such programmes can realistically be implemented and whether the level of administrative support, which should be considered in the light of the total programme, is appropriate.
7. Moreover, no information has been provided, even on a partial or half-year basis, on expenditures incurred in 1992.
In this connection, the Advisory Committee, in response to inquiry, was informed that, although the books for 1992 had not yet been closed, it appeared, in respect of the Centre in Africa, that income in 1992 fell short of 1992 expenditures by some $40,000.
With regard to the Centre in Latin America and the Caribbean, income exceeded expenditures by approximately $1,000.
Income in respect of the Centre in Asia and the Pacific far exceeded expenditure, in large measure because $500,000 was pledged for the construction of the Centre's building.
In addition, as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General, the Centre has been operating on a limited scale, although, with the appointment of the Director ad interim, in September 1992, it is expected that the Centre will operate on a consolidated and strengthened basis.
8. The Advisory Committee is also of the view that the report of the Secretary-General should have contained information in respect of any activities which are being implemented through support from other disarmament trust funds or from Headquarters.
In respect of the latter, the Advisory Committee was informed, for example, that a seminar on confidence- and security-building measures in southern Africa, held in February 1993, had been organized from Headquarters.
Representatives of the Secretary-General emphasized that this had been done precisely because of the lack of a secure infrastructure in the regional Centre in Africa.
Representatives of the Secretary-General also emphasized that not all of the activities projected for 1992 have been implemented, owing to the lack of sufficient resources from voluntary contributions, and that part of the difficulty in raising funds through voluntary contributions is that, in many cases, potential donors wished to see an infrastructure already in place at the respective centres before committing themselves to contributing to any project.
No specific information was provided to the Advisory Committee in this regard.
9. In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, the above statements illustrate that a further review by the Secretary-General should be undertaken, as discussed in paragraph 14 below.
10. As discussed above, the report of the Secretary-General is lacking in respect of the totality of the programme to be delivered in financial terms, as well as in respect of up-to-date information regarding expenditures incurred in 1992.
Equally lacking, in the Advisory Committee's view, is clear justification and substantiation of the administrative expenditures that have been proposed.
The Advisory Committee questions, for example, the number of local staff requested, in particular for the Centre in Africa.
11. The Advisory Committee also points out that the level of administrative support should be commensurate with the likely level of the programmes to be financed from extrabudgetary sources, that is, administrative costs should be linked to substantive activities (see para. 6 above).
Notwithstanding the statement by the Secretary-General regarding the reluctance of potential donors to contribute before the establishment of an infrastructure (see para. 8 above), the Advisory Committee remains of the view that administrative costs must represent a reasonable percentage of programme delivery.
12. As stated in paragraph 2 above, the Secretary-General is requesting $300,000 to cover the administrative expenses of the centres for 1993.
To this it is necessary to add the cost for the Directors for 1993 (approximately one half of the $506,900, or $253,000), which has already been appropriated for the biennium 1992-1993.
In other words, total administrative expenses borne by the regular budget in 1993 would amount to approximately $553,000.
In response to inquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that approximate expenditures in 1992 of the three centres combined, including both administrative and programme expenditures, amounted to $312,400.
As shown in the annexes to the report of the Secretary-General, for the biennium 1990-1991, combined trust fund expenditures for the centres amounted to approximately $842,700, including both administrative and programme costs; this translates to an approximate annual expenditure from the trust funds of the centres of $421,350.
13. In the circumstances, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of commitment authority of $150,000 under section 37 of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 in order to provide for the administrative support of the regional centres.
Such amount as would need to be appropriated should be a first call on the contingency fund in 1993, as it would relate to a proposal which had been carried over from 1992.
In apportioning the $150,000 among the centres, the Secretary-General should take into account all relevant factors, including the current financial status of each centre and the programme of work.
14. The Advisory Committee also recommends that the Secretary-General, in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995, submit his long-term proposals with respect to these regional centres, in particular as regards their financial viability.
Furthermore, a determination needs to be made as to which activities should be carried out by Headquarters on behalf of the centres and those to be entrusted to the centres themselves.
There is also a need, in the Advisory Committee's opinion, to have a coherent and integrated programme for the centres, bearing in mind the related activities funded under the regular budget.

Fifteenth report
Programme budget implications of draft resolution II submitted
by the Second Committee in document A/47/729
(Agenda item 89 (a))*
[17 March 1993]
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the statement submitted by the Secretary-General (A/C.5/47/82) on the programme budget implications of draft resolution II submitted by the Second Committee in document A/47/729, paragraph 21.
During its consideration of the statement, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.
2. As the Secretary-General indicates in paragraph 2 of his statement, by paragraphs 1 to 3 of draft resolution II of the Second Committee, the General Assembly would decide that (a) the UNITAR building would be transferred immediately to the United Nations in return for the cancellation of the debt of the Institute and coverage of its financial obligations for 1992; (b) the headquarters of the Institute would be transferred to Geneva; (c) the Secretary-General should designate a liaison officer to organize and coordinate the existing training programmes and research activities relating to training in New York within existing resources, drawing as appropriate on the services of senior fellows who should be funded from voluntary contributions to the Institute; and (d) as of 1 January 1993, the funding of all the Institute's administrative budget and training programmes would be covered from voluntary contributions, donations, special-purpose grants and executing agency overheads.
In this connection, the Advisory Committee points out that unless the Assembly decides otherwise the effective date for extrabudgetary funding will be the date on which the Assembly adopts the draft resolution.
3. In paragraph 16 of his statement, the Secretary-General states that should the General Assembly adopt the draft resolution, an additional appropriation of $15,989,000 would be required under section 34 (Special expenses) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
4. As recalled in paragraph 3 of the Secretary-General's statement, by its resolution 38/177 of 19 December 1983, the General Assembly provided the Institute with an advance of $886,000 from the regular budget.
The Advisory Committee was informed by representatives of the Secretary-General that UNITAR reimbursed $200,000 to the United Nations, leaving a debt of $686,000.
5. According to paragraph 8 of the Secretary-General's statement, UNITAR's debt to the United Nations, which is to be cancelled in return for the immediate transfer of the UNITAR building to the United Nations, would amount to $11,822,500 as at 31 December 1992.
The Advisory Committee has since been informed that the total debt amounted to $11.6 million as of 31 December 1992.
Of this amount, $4 million was advanced to UNITAR for the purchase of the land on which the building is situated.
The balance represents mainly advances to UNITAR to meet the shortfalls in its administrative budget.
The Committee was informed by representatives of the Secretary-General that of the latter amount $1.5 million was advanced in 1992.
6. The Advisory Committee sees no reason why the cancellation of UNITAR's debt should require an additional appropriation.
As indicated in paragraph 4 above, an amount of some $686,000 has already been appropriated.
The Committee wishes to point out that with the exception of the $1.5 million which has been committed for UNITAR in 1992, the balance has all been financed through savings in United Nations programme budgets since 1983.
Therefore, since these amounts have already been absorbed, there is no need for an additional appropriation in respect of them.
Nor, in the opinion of the Advisory Committee, is there a need, at this time, for an appropriation in respect of the $1.5 million committed in 1992 and such amounts as may be committed in 1993 (see para. 11 below); the need for an appropriation can be determined in the context of the second performance report on the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
The Advisory Committee recommends further that the accounting problem caused by the UNITAR budget be covered by an appropriate explanation in the accounts, taking into consideration the current value of the UNITAR building and land.
7. In paragraph 9 of his statement, the Secretary-General states that for the United Nations to take over the UNITAR building, it would be necessary for the Organization to incur expenses related to the maintenance and provision of security for the premises, estimated at $647,000 in 1993 and at $2,907,000 for repairs and improvements.
8. The Advisory Committee believes that any appropriation for these purposes would have to be preceded by a detailed report describing the use to which the building would be put and justifying the repairs, maintenance and improvements in terms of that use.
Pending receipt of that report no appropriation would be necessary at this time.
9. The Secretary-General indicated in paragraph 10 of his statement that, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 42/197 of 11 December 1987, the existing staff members of the UNITAR New York office (1 P-5, 1 P-4, 1 P-2 and 7 General Service) are to be absorbed within the United Nations system.
As reported in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the statement, the total costs related to absorbing these staff members, which are estimated at $612,500, include $300,500 for the financing of the staff to be redeployed, $15,500 for the rental of office space and $296,500 for general operating costs for six months.
10. The Advisory Committee points out that commitment authority of $400,000 has already been given by the General Assembly for transitional requirements for the Institute for 1993, pending the resumed session of the Assembly (see section XXIV of Assembly resolution 47/219 of 23 December 1992).
The Committee notes from paragraphs 10, 11 and 14 of the Secretary-General's statement that the estimates for transitional arrangements for these staff members are calculated for six months, from 1 January to 30 June 1993.
The Committee requests the Secretary-General to make every effort to place the staff involved quickly within the United Nations system, thus not incurring additional costs.
Additional costs could also be avoided if the staff concerned are placed in such a way as to minimize additional rental costs, wherever possible, and every effort should be made to achieve economies in general operating costs.
11. The Advisory Committee has been informed that of the $400,000 authorized by the General Assembly, $253,500 had already been committed.
The Committee, taking into account the contents of paragraph 13 of the Secretary-General's statement, recommends that the Secretary-General be given commitment authority for an additional $200,000 to cover requirements through June 1993 and that actual requirements be reported in the context of the second performance report on the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
12. In the circumstances, the Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform the General Assembly that, should draft resolution II of the Second Committee be adopted, no additional appropriation would be required at this time.

Sixteenth report
Revised estimates as requested by the General Assembly
in its resolution 47/212 A
[24 March 1993]
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/47/88), which contains the revisions to the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 proposed to the General Assembly in connection with the restructuring of the Secretariat initiated by the Secretary-General.
2. The Secretary-General states in the report that the translation into budgetary and programmatic terms of the restructuring involves the creation of new departments and the redeployment of posts and redistribution of resources among various sections of the programme budget for the remaining part of the biennium 1992-1993.
Accordingly, he requests, among other things, the approval of the General Assembly for transfers of resources among sections of the programme budget as detailed in his report and for a revised appropriation of $2,467,775,800.
This amount is $263,400 less than the amount approved by the Assembly in its resolution 47/220 A of 23 December 1992.
I. BACKGROUND AND GENERAL OBSERVATIONS
3. In his note of 21 February 1992, 1/ the Secretary-General announced changes he had made with the intent of consolidating and streamlining the Organization's activities into well-defined functional categories aimed at ensuring effective implementation of the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and of the mandates entrusted by the policy-making organs.
4. In its resolution 46/232 of 2 March 1992, the General Assembly, inter alia, took note of those actions and approved the launching by the Secretary-General of a further process of restructuring and streamlining of the Secretariat.
The Assembly also set forth the aims of the restructuring and requested the Secretary-General to report on the programmatic impact as well as the financial implications of organizational changes involved in his initiatives.
Subsequently, in its resolution 47/212 A of 23 December 1992, the Assembly, inter alia, stressed that the restructuring of the Secretariat should be in conformity with the objectives and guidelines/principles set out in resolution 46/232 and in close consultation with Member States and relevant intergovernmental bodies.
The Assembly also requested the Secretary-General to submit early in 1993 revised estimates in respect of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 with all the revisions associated with the restructuring process as well as the programmatic aspects and justifications of the restructuring requested in resolution 46/232.
5. The conduct of the Advisory Committee's work was made more difficult by the late submission of the report of the Secretary-General, which was not available to the Committee until some two weeks after it had been expected.
6. A major difficulty the Advisory Committee had in considering the report was that it lacked a context, a long-term concept or framework for the whole process of restructuring and information on how the restructuring of the Secretariat fitted into that process.
The Committee believes that there is a need for a clear statement of an overall restructuring plan and a time-frame for its implementation.
The report of the Secretary-General should have demonstrated how the proposed changes would, in fact, better enable the Secretariat to respond to the relevant intergovernmental decisions, particularly General Assembly resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986, and to the programme mandates, entrusted to it by the Member States, and how the restructuring would achieve the management aim of a "more responsive, cost-effective, streamlined Secretariat" (ibid., para. 7).
7. As stated by the Secretary-General in paragraph 3 of his report, his conclusions benefited from the advice of high-level independent experts.
That being the case, the Advisory Committee is of the view that in order to understand fully the genesis of the proposals, the report of the high-level independent experts should have been provided to it.
The Committee cautions against an over-reliance on external consultant expertise and recommends that the considerable in-house expertise be utilized and taken into account.
8. The Advisory Committee's comments and observations in the paragraphs below are intended to be taken into account not only at the present juncture but also when the Secretary-General's proposals for the programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995 are being prepared and reviewed.
II. FORMAT AND PRESENTATION
9. The revised estimates are not submitted in a complete budget format.
Although it is stated that programmatic justification is provided for each element of the restructuring and that the specific mandates and activities embodied in the current medium-term plan and the programme budget will be implemented by the restructured departments and units, those mandates are not consistently identified.
This was particularly so with regard to a number of the activities under the proposed three new departments, 2/ for example, under the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis, the analysis, at the micro-economic level, of the use of market mechanisms and the role of the firm, and the linkage of the Department's activities with early warning capabilities being developed in the political and humanitarian sectors of the Organization.
The Committee notes from paragraph 40 (a) of the report of the Secretary-General that the Department for Development Support and Management Services will "give particular attention to the requirements of the least developed countries and those of economies in transition".
The Committee trusts that the implementation of those activities will be fully consistent with legislative mandates.
In this regard, in response to inquiries regarding paragraphs 21 (c) and 40 (a) of the report, the representatives of the Secretary-General stated that it was not intended to change the priorities agreed to by Member States.
10. The report also fails to show the distribution of subprogrammes and resource allocation among the departments or how the mandates and activities provided for in the medium-term plan will, in fact, be implemented.
This, in the Advisory Committee's view, greatly reduces the ability of all concerned to evaluate the "global" allocation of resources among departments and adequately to assess the programmatic impact of such changes.
The Committee reaffirms the importance of continuing to apply the present regulations and rules governing programme planning and the programme aspects of the budget, and in particular financial rule 103.4.
11. In fact, because the internal structures of the new departments have yet to be finalized, it is not possible to evaluate how the restructuring will result in "organizational units with more focused and precise terms of reference and clear lines of responsibility and accountability" (ibid.).
Indeed, the report states that the "identification of duplications and redundancies that might exist in the various units of the Secretariat implementing mandated activities will take place in the context of the preparation of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995" (ibid., introduction).
In principle, consolidations of this kind should lead to greater staff and management efficiency.
12. The Secretary-General also states that the resources appropriated under objects of expenditure other than salaries and common staff costs have been redistributed on a functional or proportionate basis, taking into account, in particular, the minimum requirements of the new departments in relation to their overall work programme.
In other words, no detailed allocation of resources by subprogramme has been done.
That being the case, the provisions "will be managed in a flexible manner to accommodate priority requirements of the three departments ... for the remainder of the year" (ibid., para. 83).
In this connection, the Advisory Committee was informed that the corresponding budget sections for the departments will be separate sections in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
13. In paragraph 88 of his report, the Secretary-General recalls that "the resources for the activities related to the new mandates stemming from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development were appropriated by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session, in December 1992, for the period 1 January-31 March 1993 only, on the understanding that the level of these resources would be reviewed in the context of the present revised estimates".
For the reasons provided in paragraphs 89 and 90, the Secretary-General states in paragraph 90 that in view of the overall projected savings resulting from the restructuring, no additional appropriation is needed.
14. In its resolution 47/212 A, the General Assembly invited the Committee for Programme and Coordination and other concerned intergovernmental bodies to submit their comments and recommendations concerning the programmatic aspects and consequences of the restructuring of the Secretariat in the areas of their competence to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session, and took note of the revised estimates arising from the initial phase of the restructuring, on the understanding that, pending the work of the relevant intergovernmental bodies, the Secretary-General would submit early in 1993 revised estimates in respect of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
Consequently, the revised estimates cannot reflect the comments and recommendations of the Committee for Programme and Coordination and other relevant intergovernmental bodies.
That being the case, the Committee recommends that such reviews be undertaken before the Assembly considers and approves the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
The Advisory Committee has regularly stressed the importance of the involvement of specialized bodies in the planning and programming process. 3/
15. As stated above, the revised estimates appear, at face value, to be cost neutral.
However, the Advisory Committee notes that the various categories of costs shown in table II relate to differing periods within the biennium; there is no indication of the biennialized costs of the resulting structure that could be compared to the structure reflected in the initial appropriation for the biennium 1992-1993.
The lack of such information in the report, as well as a clear presentation of the new structure by programme budget section, hinders an evaluation of the financial effects of the restructuring.
These comments should not be misinterpreted to infer that the Committee believes that the only purpose of the restructuring was to reduce the budget.
Nevertheless, full disclosure of the financial impact is necessary for a proper analysis.
III. ORGANIZATIONAL PROPOSALS
16. As detailed in his report, the Secretary-General is proposing changes in the organizational structure of the economic and social sectors, the political and humanitarian sectors, and the public information and common support service sectors.
The Advisory Committee discussed these changes at length with the representatives of the Secretary-General, including his Special Adviser.
The representative of the Secretary-General acknowledged that the fact that the proposals for restructuring were presented in the revised estimates made the understanding of the proposals very difficult.
He elaborated on the functional objectives of the restructuring, which consist in:
(a) Overcoming shortcomings such as:
(i) The long-term tendency of various components of the Organization to develop work programmes in isolation from each other;
(ii) The tendency for the Organization, sometimes based on Member States' initiatives, to create new Secretariat entities whenever new agendas are adopted and to present contradictory policy recommendations to Member States on the same issues;
(b) Creating a more manageable set of units and components of the Secretariat.
17. The representative of the Secretary-General further explained that, thanks to the economies of scale to be achieved, enough long-term savings would be expected to accommodate new activities deriving from the various forthcoming global United Nations conferences without requiring additional structure and resources in the bienniums to come, unless decisions to the contrary were taken by Member States.
Although the Advisory Committee benefited from those discussions, it believes that, in a number of areas, further analysis and more compelling justification need to be outlined to Member States in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995 to be submitted by the Secretary-General.
18. In making the above observations, the Advisory Committee emphasizes that it does not question the substantive policy considerations underlying the proposed creation of the three new departments 2/ that the Secretary-General announced in his note (A/47/753) and further elaborated in paragraph 20 of his report (A/C.5/47/88).
However, there is need for more detailed explanation of the various components, structure and operation of those departments.
19. In particular, the Advisory Committee is of the view that more justification is needed in relation to the transfer of functions and posts between duty stations with regard to activities pertaining to social development and the advancement of women, the World Food Council, transnational corporations, science and technology for development and the peaceful uses of outer space.
20. In the Advisory Committee's view, despite the explanations contained in the report and elaborated on by representatives of the Secretary-General, the rationale behind the proposals relating to these transfers has not been adequately or fully explained and outstanding questions remain to be addressed, in particular with regard to the proposals to break up the social development nucleus at Vienna and to transfer programmes relating to transnational corporations, science and technology for development and the peaceful uses of outer space.
21. With regard to Vienna, the Secretary-General acknowledges that issues relating to the United Nations Office at Vienna will be elaborated during the course of the current year.
The absence of that information at the present time is regrettable; the Committee trusts that, as stated, relevant proposals (and justification) will be contained in the proposed programme budget to be submitted by the Secretary-General, taking into account the decisions of the relevant intergovernmental bodies.
22. Related to the above is the issue of decentralization, which, as stated by the Secretary-General, is an important and integral part of the current restructuring exercise.
However, as discussed in paragraphs 60 and 61 of his report, a decision has not yet been made regarding which activities could be more effectively carried out at the regional level; information in this regard will only be reflected in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
This in turn makes it difficult to evaluate other proposals of the Secretary-General and therefore the decision on the transfer of functions and posts between duty stations should be further elaborated in the context of the decentralization process.
23. In view of what is stated in paragraphs 21 and 22 above, it is for the General Assembly, taking into account its previous decisions as well as justifications provided by the Secretary-General, to decide, with regard to the Secretary-General's various proposals described above, on the best way of proceeding with regard to the transfer of functions between duty stations.
24. The Secretary-General states in paragraph 63 of his report that "the consensus about the need for a unified United Nations presence and approach at the country level has continued to grow".
In this connection, the Advisory Committee emphasizes the need for full consultation with Member States with respect to all issues related to the concept of the unified United Nations presence at the country level based upon the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.
25. As mentioned, the Secretary-General's proposals involve the transfer of posts among various duty stations (Rome, New York, Geneva and Vienna).
The Secretary-General estimates the full costs for the relocation of staff at approximately $2 million, as shown in paragraph 79 (b) and table II of his report (ibid).
The Committee notes, however, that there are other potential costs which have not been included in that figure.
These include the cost of additional office space, if required, and the Advisory Committee trusts that the Secretary-General's proposals for the biennium 1994-1995 will provide clear information regarding differential costs of office space and any increases/decreases in costs attributable to the restructuring.
26. Additional costs may also arise with regard to the separation of staff who cannot locate a new assignment.
Because of the Secretary-General's stated commitment in his statement on personnel questions to the Fifth Committee that no staff member should lose his or her job as a result of the restructuring, such costs have not been included in the revised estimates.
However, in the Advisory Committee's opinion, the possibility of separations agreed upon by both staff and administration does exist and the consequent cost will need to be identified.
27. The Advisory Committee notes that additional costs may also arise in respect of the servicing of intergovernmental bodies whose secretariats are proposed for transfer, pending any decision by the relevant bodies regarding their location.
In addition, there may well be additional costs to Member States arising out of the relocation of these venues of intergovernmental bodies.
28. The Secretary-General's proposal to integrate the Office for Project Services of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) into the new Department for Development Support and Management Services, responds, as stated in the report, to repeated concerns about the compatibility of the functions and present location of the Office with the primary purpose of UNDP as a central coordinating and funding mechanism; it also addresses concerns about duplication in the delivery of technical cooperation services.
These same concerns have been highlighted by the Advisory Committee in recent years in the context of its examination of the UNDP administrative budget.
The Committee therefore welcomes the overall objective of the proposal.
29. At the same time, it emphasizes that for such integration to succeed, a number of serious and potentially contentious issues must be dealt with by the joint task force that has been established to oversee the procedures to be put in place for the incorporation of the Office into the new Department.
The Advisory Committee discussed some of these issues with representatives of the Secretary-General, including the provision of central services to the Office, which is currently done by UNDP and which would need to be done by the United Nations.
30. The Advisory Committee requests the Secretary-General to submit a detailed report to it on the modalities that have been worked out before the proposed date of incorporation of 1 January 1994.
The report should include information not only on how the conditions of operation enumerated in paragraph 102 of the report of the Secretary-General are to be met, but also on the projected magnitude of the portfolio of the Office for Project Services corresponding with its mandate and its internal organization to handle that portfolio.
31. In making this recommendation, the Advisory Committee notes that since the Office will absorb the functions similar to those currently carried out in the Department of Economic and Social Development, it will in effect become the largest operational agency of the United Nations.
Care must be taken to ensure that the integration results in the elimination of any duplication of effort and, at the same time, that the consequent administrative structure does not become inflated or unwieldy because of its very size.
In this connection, the Committee recalls that, as stated in the report of the Administrator (DP/1992/45), the Office for Project Services had renewed its effort to utilize the technical expertise of the United Nations agencies for the implementation of components of projects executed by it.
In its related report (see DP/1992/39), the Advisory Committee welcomed that development and stated its hope that this would lead to improved burden-sharing, coordination and cooperation among entities of the system, based upon a clear definition of their respective areas of competence.
The movement of the Office does not, in the Advisory Committee's view, change that position.
The intent remains to ensure the delivery of the best and most cost-effective technical cooperation to meet the requirements of the developing countries.
32. The Secretary-General's proposals in the economic and social sectors give rise to questions concerning the required coordination.
The Secretary-General addresses this question, in part, in paragraphs 64 and 65 of his report, stating that arrangements in this regard are being reviewed and strengthened.
The Advisory Committee stresses the importance of such coordination and trusts that more detailed information regarding the discharge of responsibilities formerly entrusted to the Director-General for Development and International Economic Cooperation and the Secretary-General's intentions in this regard will be forthcoming.
IV. PROPOSALS RELATING TO THE DEPARTMENT
OF ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT
33. The Secretary-General's proposals in the public information and common support service sector (A/C.5/47/88, paras. 69-72) involve, inter alia, the transfer of the Library from within the Office of Conference Services within the Department of Administration and Management to the Department of Public Information, as well as the transfer of certain functions of the Publishing Division to the same Department.
The Advisory Committee understands that the proposals derive from an external consultant's report that was not made available to it; it also understands that they were not scrutinized and debated within the Secretariat to the same extent as those in the economic and social sectors and that various refinements are possible.
The Committee requests the Secretary-General to indicate the results of any possible refinements in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995, taking into account the relevant decisions of the General Assembly.
Questions also arise as to the role of the Committee on Information vis-à-vis library services and the need for the units concerned to coordinate substantive and technical support to the Committee on Conferences with respect to its consideration of publications policies.
34. Other elements of the restructuring of the Department of Administration and Management involve the internal transfer of the Field Operations Division from the Office of General Services to the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management.
The Advisory Committee points out that significant issues with respect to the management and administration of peace-keeping remain unresolved, including the interaction and coordination between the servicing, financial and political units involved.
The Advisory Committee requests the Secretary-General to deal with these issues on an urgent basis.
V. VACANCY MANAGEMENT
35. As recalled in paragraph 74 of his report, the Secretary-General's previous revised estimates contained a description of a new treatment of vacancies, which had been initiated and which the Secretary-General intended to continue through the establishment of appropriate procedures as posts became vacant during the course of the biennium.
Table IV of the report provides an updated breakdown of the temporary redeployment of vacant Professional posts.
36. Representatives of the Secretary-General stressed that the redeployment of these posts was temporary and that if it were determined that the redeployment was needed for a longer period, the authority of the General Assembly and/or the Advisory Committee would be sought, in conformity with the relevant financial provisions.
In this connection, the Committee recalls that in paragraph 20 of its report, (see document A/47/7/Add.1 above), it noted the Secretary-General's explanation that the authority for most transfers was currently done on an ex post facto basis; however, it would be his intention to apply the provisions of financial regulation 4.5 and financial rule 104.4 to ensure the meaningful involvement of the Assembly or the Advisory Committee regarding the transfer of resources/posts during the execution of a programme budget.
During the course of the Committee's examination of the Secretary-General's current report, representatives of the Secretary-General reiterated to the Committee their intention to report to it at six-month intervals regarding the status of the posts that had been temporarily redeployed among sections.
While welcoming the intention, the Committee requests that such reporting should include programmatic justifications for the redeployment and be submitted not only to it but also to the relevant intergovernmental bodies for their information as appropriate.
VI. HIGH-LEVEL POSTS
37. As recalled in paragraphs 9 and 10 of document A/C.5/47/88, the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 as adopted by the General Assembly included 48 high-level posts; the corresponding number prior to the implementation of recommendation 15 of the Group of High-level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations 4/ was 57.
The revised estimates submitted in the report of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/47/2 and Corr.1) provided for a total of 36 regular budget high-level posts, including that of assistant secretary-general of the head of the International Trade Centre (ITC).
In its resolution 47/212 A, the Assembly decided to postpone action on those proposals.
The Secretary-General is now making a number of additional proposals, as outlined in paragraph 11 of his report (A/C.5/47/88), the net result of which would, as stated in paragraph 12 of the report, lead to a further reduction of three high-level posts, excluding the proposal with respect to the ITC post at the assistant secretary-general level.
However, he requests the retention of the resources attached to three Assistant secretary-general-level posts.
The Committee was informed that the present location of those resources would not necessarily determine where they would be utilized.
38. The Secretary-General states his intention, with regard to the post at the level of assistant secretary-general of head of ITC, which is financed jointly by the Organization and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), to advise the Director-General of GATT that the position of the United Nations is that the post stands abolished and that the Centre should be headed at the D-2 level.
In this connection, the Advisory Committee points out that before action is taken a decision is required by both GATT and the General Assembly.
The Committee would welcome the advice of the Trade and Development Board and/or its appropriate subsidiary bodies on this proposal.
39. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 17 of his report (ibid.) that the Secretary-General will propose to abolish a number of high-level posts financed from extrabudgetary resources to the concerned governing bodies.
The Committee trusts that the proposals will be made taking into account the operational needs and workload of the programmes concerned.
40. The Advisory Committee appreciates the efforts of the Secretary-General to streamline the senior management structure of the Secretariat.
The Committee assumes that the purpose of this exercise is not necessarily to achieve cost savings, which would be minimal in relation to the programme budget as a whole, but rather to assure "clear lines of responsibility and accountability", as referred to in paragraph 7 of his report.
However, the Advisory Committee failed to detect a clear rationale that would explain the proposals put forward in document A/C.5/47/2 and Corr.1 and those contained in paragraphs 11 and 13 of document A/C.5/47/88.
Nor is there adequate detailed justification for each and every proposal such as one might expect to find in a fully justified proposed programme budget document.
In this connection, the Advisory Committee was informed that there were no set objective classification criteria for high-level posts.
The Advisory Committee recommends that such criteria be developed.
41. The Advisory Committee had particular difficulty with the proposals relating to the Department of Administration and Management.
This Department is concerned with the overall administration and management of United Nations operations, including, in addition to the regular budget, peace-keeping activities and extrabudgetary expenditure.
With the incorporation of conference services, this Department is the largest, in terms of staff members, in the United Nations.
The Department is responsible for directly carrying out and/or monitoring the effective implementation of policies that are at the very core of the functioning of the Organization.
In order to carry out their tasks effectively, the most senior officials of this Department should have a degree of authority that is equivalent to that of the most senior officials in the other areas of the United Nations.
42. The Advisory Committee therefore recommends that action on the Secretary-General's proposals regarding the four high-level posts in the Department of Administration and Management be deferred and that the Secretary-General be given the opportunity to review them, in the light of such comments as the General Assembly may wish to make, and to justify and explain more fully these changes in the context of his proposals for the programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
In reviewing this matter the Secretary-General should also take into account the considerations referred to in paragraphs 44 to 48 below.
43. In addition to the proposals regarding the high-level posts in the Department of Administration and Management, the General Assembly will need to consider the other proposals contained in document A/C.5/47/88 as well as those contained in document A/C.5/47/2 and Corr.1, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 47/212 A.
44. Closely related to the Secretary-General's proposals for high-level posts are his ideas with regard to a senior career post at a level above D-2 for selected high-level managerial responsibilities, which would, as stated in paragraph 14 of his report (ibid), be equivalent in terms of salary and related entitlements to the Assistant Secretary-General level.
The Secretary-General intends to submit a study that will identify a limited number of positions for this purpose.
45. The Advisory Committee was not given a clear statement of purpose for such an innovation.
If the objective of the creation of a D-3 post is to provide greater career development for the "permanent" civil service, the Committee questions how the creation of such a limited number of positions will have a significant impact on the career prospects of staff currently at the Professional level and above.
If the purpose of the creation of a D-3 level would be to clarify reporting lines in the chain of command, the Advisory Committee believes that such a clarification can be achieved through measures that would avoid tampering with the time-tested structure of the international career civil service (see para. 47 below).
In addition, the Committee points out that the creation of such a level would in all probability have system-wide implications requiring lengthy and complicated inter-agency consultations; it would, therefore, in the opinion of the Advisory Committee, require study by the International Civil Service Commission.
46. The Advisory Committee cautions that the creation of a D-3 level would, over time, tend to create pressure for additional D-3 posts and eventually defeat the objective of rationalizing the number of high-echelon posts.
It also notes that it appears not to be the intent to eliminate all assistant secretary-general posts and to replace them with positions at the career level of D-3.
In the circumstances, the Advisory Committee believes that it would cause needless confusion to have equivalent levels that are in different categories.
The confusion might very well extend to the exercise of authority - a D-3 could in fact become known as a "second-class Assistant Secretary-General" - and this would diminish authority in vital areas of administration and control.
47. The Advisory Committee points out that positions equivalent to those at assistant secretary-general level are often given titles other than Assistant Secretary-General, such as the Assistant Administrators in UNDP and the Assistant Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund, and, elsewhere in the United Nations system, Assistant Directors-General.
The need within the top echelon to clarify reporting might be more easily accomplished through the issuance of a Secretary-General's bulletin to outline reporting responsibilities.
The Advisory Committee believes that this most senior category of officials should continue to have an appropriate mix of "career" and "non-career" appointees, and that procedures in place to facilitate this should be maintained.
48. In the circumstances, the Advisory Committee notes that the proposal to establish the D-3 posts may not be so advanced during the current biennium as to require use of the resources retained for that purpose (see para. 37 above).

Seventeenth report
Revised estimates under section 31 (Public information) resulting
from the establishment of seven United Nations interim offices
[30 March 1993]
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the establishment of seven United Nations interim offices (A/C.5/47/89).
During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the United Nations and of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), who provided additional information.
2. As the Secretary-General indicated in paragraph 2 of his report, the General Assembly, in section XVIII, paragraph 2, of its resolution 47/219 A of 23 December 1992, requested him:
"to re-submit a complete report on the establishment and operation of the seven United Nations interim offices, including staffing, project implementation and an integrated budget with full sources of financing, at its resumed forty-seventh session, in accordance with the relevant resolutions and decisions of the competent United Nations bodies regarding operational activities and public information activities and taking into account the views expressed by the Member States in the Fifth Committee on this issue during the forty-seventh session;".
3. In March 1992, the Secretary-General decided to establish integrated United Nations offices in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, and, subsequently, in Georgia.
The responsibility for the establishment of those offices, which are initially to focus on development assistance and information support to the seven countries, had been entrusted to the Department of Public Information and UNDP.
4. The objectives and functions of the interim offices are summarized in paragraphs 16 to 19 of the Secretary-General's report.
5. The administrative and financial arrangements and budgetary requirements are covered in paragraphs 20 to 30 of the Secretary-General's report.
Each interim office will have one United Nations representative and a deputy to represent the United Nations and its programmes as a whole.
There would thus be a total of 14 Professional and higher-level posts and 42 local field posts for the seven interim offices.
The United Nations would provide for seven Professional posts (three D-1, one P-5 and three P-4) and seven local field posts (ibid., para. 20).
6. The Secretary-General, in paragraph 21 of his report, states that the United Nations and UNDP had agreed in principle to share equally the start-up and recurrent operating costs for the seven interim offices, with the understanding that the United Nations share of such costs would not exceed $85,000 per office, or $595,000 for 12 months for the seven offices, plus $274,200 for extraordinary requirements for the office in Armenia.
Furthermore, a provision of $200,200 would be required for general temporary assistance with regard to three Professional posts and $175,000 for seven local field posts.
8. The details of the project cost estimates and sources of funding during the biennium 1992-1993 are provided in paragraphs 23 and 24 of the Secretary-General's report and are summarized in the annex thereto.
As indicated in the annex, the estimated resource requirements in the biennium 1992-1993 for the seven offices totals $4,149,100.
Of that total, $1,822,900 ($1,244,400 on a net basis) would come from the United Nations; $2,008,400 would be financed by UNDP ($1,400,900 from the UNDP Governing Council allocation, $450,000 from the application of indicative planning figure resources and $157,500 from other sources of funding) and $317,800 from payments by the Governments of the host countries for government local office costs.
The Governments of the host countries would also provide suitable rent-free premises for the interim offices.
The Advisory Committee received no clear indication of the basis for the United Nations share of 30 per cent, nor is it clear why the United Nations share should be entirely funded from public information resources.
9. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 14 of the Secretary-General's report that the Governing Council of UNDP, in its decisions 92/29 and 92/43 of 26 May 1992, 1/ approved an allocation of up to $3 million from within the approved 1992-1993 UNDP administrative budget for the financing of those offices.
10. With regard to the United Nations source of funding for those offices, the Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 31 of the Secretary-General's report that no activities were proposed for termination, deferral, curtailment or modification under section 31 (Public Information) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 in order to finance the seven interim offices.
Part of the amount of $1,822,900, the United Nations share of the cost on a full-cost basis, would be met by temporary redeployment of staff, thus bringing the net requirement to $1,244,400.
Consequently, the Secretary-General requests an appropriation of $1,244,400 from the United Nations regular budget in order to cover the United Nations share of the cost.
11. It is the view of the Advisory Committee, however, that the policy decision with regard to the financing of the offices from the regular budget has yet to be taken by the relevant intergovernmental bodies.
That being the case, no mandate yet exists for the Committee to recommend funding from the regular budget.
12. Under the circumstances, the Advisory Committee recommends that the Secretary-General's report to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session should be considered by the Committee on Information and the Special Political Committee before it is submitted to the Fifth Committee.
Such action as the Assembly may take can then be reflected in the appropriate manner in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
In the meantime, the Advisory Committee takes note of the initiative taken by the Secretary-General to establish the seven interim offices.
The Committee recommends that the arrangements now in place should be considered provisional and exceptional and should continue until the Assembly has taken a policy decision on the matter.

Eighteenth report
Programme budget implications of the draft resolution contained
in document A/47/L.56
(Agenda item 22)*
[16 April 1993]
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the statement (A/C.5/47/93), submitted by the Secretary-General in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, on the programme budget implications of the draft resolution, relating to the situation of democracy and human rights in Haiti which is contained in document A/47/L.56.
2. The Advisory Committee recalls that, following the adoption on 24 November 1992 of General Assembly resolution 47/20 A, in which, inter alia, the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures in order to assist, in cooperation with the Organization of American States (OAS), in the solution of the Haitian crisis, the Secretary-General appointed a Special Envoy for Haiti and dispatched an advance team, a survey group and human rights experts to that country.
For the financing of those requirements, the Committee authorized the Secretary-General to enter into commitments of up to $1 million; that amount has now been incorporated into the budget estimates submitted in the Secretary-General's statement under consideration.
3. Pursuant to the request contained in paragraph 10 of General Assembly resolution 47/20 A, the Secretary-General submitted a report (A/47/908) in which he recommends inter alia, that the General Assembly establish the United Nations component of a United Nations/OAS joint International Civilian Mission to Haiti.
That report also forms the basis for the preparation of the budget estimates submitted for consideration.
4. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 5 of the Secretary-General's statement that the Mission to Haiti would include a United Nations and an OAS contingent of observers of equal strength.
Although it is the Secretary-General's view that, given the joint nature of the Mission, those costs should be equally shared between the two organizations, the Committee was informed, on inquiry, that agreement is being worked out on the subject.
5. As set out in paragraph 7 of the statement, the proposed staffing for the United Nations component of the Mission includes one post at the Under-Secretary-General level for the Special Envoy and one post at the Assistant Secretary-General level for the Executive Director, the related costs * The situation of democracy and human rights in Haiti. to be shared by the United Nations and OAS.
The Advisory Committee was informed that formal agreement is also being worked out in this regard.
The Committee notes that provision has been made by the United Nations for 196 international staff, including 133 human rights observers.
With regard to the other 63 staff, including 7 human rights coordinators, who would be performing administrative and supervisory functions for the joint Mission, the Committee could not be provided, at this stage, with an indication as to the source of funding.
6. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 8 of the statement that options for possible transfer of surplus equipment from existing missions are currently under review.
However, since such equipment has not yet been identified, no allowance has been made for such transfers.
7. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 13 of the statement that the Secretary-General has established a Trust Fund for Haiti and intends to solicit voluntary contributions to help meet costs related to this effort.
8. Estimated requirements at full cost for the Mission for 1993 are given in paragraph 10 of the statement, and in annex III to the statement.
However, as indicated in paragraph 11, the actual cost to the United Nations is likely to be less than the amount indicated; but the exact amount cannot be estimated until a formula has been agreed with OAS on the modalities for sharing the costs between the two organizations.
As indicated in paragraph 12 of the statement, the Secretary-General will report further on requirements for 1993 when the discussions with OAS have been concluded and request such additional appropriations or commitment authority as required.
The Advisory Committee has been informed that a report will be submitted in September pursuant to paragraph 9 of draft resolution A/47/L.56 and taking into account paragraph 95 of annex III to the Secretary-General's report (ibid.) that it is important that a comprehensive review of the operational plan take place not later than September 1993 so that it can be revised in the light of experience.
10. Under the circumstances, and pending submission of a comprehensive report by the Secretary-General in September, the Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform the General Assembly that, should the Assembly adopt draft resolution A/47/L.56, an amount of up to $19,112,600 would be required for the objects of expenditure outlined in paragraph 10 of the Secretary-General's statement.
11. The representatives of the Secretary-General informed the Advisory Committee that assessment of the relevant amounts is not necessary at this stage.
That being the case, and seeing that a report will be submitted by the Secretary-General in September 1993 (see paras. 9 and 10 above), the Committee believes that the Secretary-General should be authorized to enter into further commitments of up to $18.1 million (commitment authority for $1 million was already granted as is stated in paragraph 2 above).
Such amounts as may be necessary can be appropriated and assessed on the basis of the proposals contained in the Secretary-General's report in September 1993, which would indicate, inter alia, the results of the negotiations with OAS on cost sharing, the performance of the mission to date and the status of the voluntary contributions to the Trust Fund.
In this connection, the Committee trusts that the Secretary-General will intensify efforts to collect voluntary contributions, which will also help to ensure the necessary cash flow.

Granting of travel assistance to least developed and other developing countries that are members of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
1. At the 23rd meeting of the Fifth Committee, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions said that, as indicated in the note by the Secretary-General (A/C.5/47/CRP.1), since the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) was an intergovernmental body whose members were nominated directly by their Governments, granting travel assistance would constitute an exception to the existing policy established by the General Assembly and would need to be authorized by the Assembly.
It should also be noted that UNCITRAL met annually, that its session alternated between New York and Vienna and that its three working groups, composed of all the members of the Commission, each held two sessions a year, either in New York or at Vienna.
While UNCITRAL had considered the possibility, as recommended in Assembly resolution 46/56 B of 9 December 1991, of holding consecutive meetings of its working groups, it had concluded, for the reasons mentioned in its report, a/ that the idea was impracticable and that the holding of consecutive working group meetings would not result in a lesser number of experts travelling to such meetings or produce savings on travel costs.
2. In that regard, the note by the Secretary-General indicated that the estimated cost of providing travel assistance would depend on the number of eligible representatives under the criteria decided upon and the number of meetings for which assistance would be authorized.
It also stated that, if funding was to be provided from the regular budget, it would be necessary to identify activities in the legal programme that would be changed, curtailed or terminated to accommodate related costs, and the wider budgetary implications of establishing new travel entitlements from the regular budget would need to be considered.
The Secretary-General also mentioned the possibility, as a means of funding travel assistance within existing resources, of establishing a voluntary fund, that is a trust fund, for that purpose.
3. In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, the Fifth Committee would need to address the following questions.
First, it must consider whether such travel assistance should be granted.
In that connection, the Advisory Committee recalled that, as a special exception to the rules adopted by the General Assembly governing the payment of travel expenses and related expenses of members of United Nations organs, the Assembly, in its resolution 31/93 of 14 December 1976, had authorized the payment of travel expenses to members of the Committee for Programme and Coordination.
Secondly, it must decide whether such assistance should be limited to the least developed countries or be extended to other developing countries, in which case there would have to be agreement on the criteria to be applied.
Thirdly, decisions would have to be taken on the number of meetings for which assistance would be authorized and whether such assistance would be financed from voluntary contributions or from the regular budget.
In the latter case, a statement of programme budget implications would be submitted in the normal manner. (See A/C.5/47/SR.23, paras. 53-55.)
Programme budget implications of the draft resolution submitted by the First Committee in its report (A/47/690, para. 11), concerning agenda item 60*
4. At the 29th meeting, the Chairman of the Fifth Committee said that the Advisory Committee recommended that the Fifth Committee should inform the General Assembly that, should the Assembly adopt the draft resolution, it would * Chemical and bacteriological (biological) weapons. need to authorize the Secretary-General to provide, on an exceptional basis, the required services to the Preparatory Commission for the Organization on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons as an advance from the General Fund of up to $626,000 to be reimbursed to the United Nations by the Preparatory Commission on a priority basis within 90 days of the beginning of the rendering of services by the United Nations, in other words, before 15 April 1993. (See A/C.5/47/SR.29, para. 63.)
Programme budget implications of the draft resolutions contained in documents A/47/L.17 and L.18, concerning agenda item 18*
5. At the 31st meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the activities called for under the draft resolutions were described in paragraphs 1 to 11 of the statement of programme budget implications submitted by the Secretary-General (A/C.5/47/48).
The additional requirements at full cost were discussed in paragraphs 12 to 17.
Paragraph 14 indicated total additional requirements of $541,400 (including $293,800 for the holding of a seminar in the Pacific region).
In the light of past experience in implementing the programme of work of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, the Secretary-General estimated that requirements would not exceed $379,000, a figure which fell within the balance of the appropriation under section 37 (Department of Political Affairs) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
Recommendation of the Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters contained in document A/47/345
6. At the 32nd meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the subvention to the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) from the regular budget of the United Nations was governed by the provisions of article VIII, paragraph 3, of the statute of UNIDIR.
The General Assembly had approved an appropriation of $440,000 in the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 under section 5 (Disarmament) for that purpose; the first subvention, for 1992, had been considered at the previous session, and the question of second subvention, for 1993, was before the Fifth Committee.
In keeping with the observation of the Advisory Committee that a formal request for a subvention for 1993 would have to be made to the Assembly, the Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters had recommended a subvention amounting to $220,000.
7. Should the General Assembly decide to approve the recommendation, there would be no additional programme budget implications, as the amount had already been included in the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
The Advisory Committee reaffirmed its view that support costs for the Institute should be financed from voluntary contributions tied to specific projects, and requested that the matter should be specifically addressed in future reports requesting subventions from the regular budget. (See A/C.5/47/SR.32, paras. 14 and 15.)
International Computing Centre: 1993 budget estimates
No additional expenditure would be required from the regular budget.
9. He said that the method of presenting the ICC budget estimates was indeed confusing.
The ICC budget estimates were calculated from projections by the participating organizations of the level of services required, which ICC was obligated to provide.
If the Committee reduced the estimates, it would have to justify its action by saying which organizations using ICC services should cut their requirements.
That would be difficult to do.
The Fifth Committee could of course take whatever action it saw fit, but the result might be to reduce the capacity of ICC to meet the demands made upon it. (See A/C.5/47/SR.32, paras. 38 and 49.)
Programme budget implications of the draft resolution submitted by the Sixth Committee in its report (A/47/588, para. 9), concerning agenda item 133*
10. At the 32nd meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that by the draft resolution submitted by the Sixth Committee the General Assembly would authorize the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization to hold its next session from 1 to 19 March 1993 in order to continue its work on the question of the peaceful settlement of disputes between States and to consider other proposals.
Also by the draft resolution, the Assembly would request the Special Committee to submit a report on its work to the Assembly at its forty-eighth session.
In his statement of programme budget implications (A/C.5/47/56), the Secretary-General indicated that the conference-servicing requirements of $310,800 would be met from within the appropriations authorized under the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
Accordingly, the adoption of the draft resolution would entail no additional programme budget implications for the biennium. (See A/C.5/47/SR.32, para. 1.)
11. At the 36th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the Committee had noted that the reasons for the proposed revisions were not clearly stated in the documents submitted to the General Assembly.
It had been informed by representatives of the Secretary-General, however, that the primary reason had been the need to take into account the effect of the restructuring of the Secretariat.
The restructuring had led to a merger of major programmes IX and X into a single major programme, IX, entitled "Common support services".
As could be seen from the proposed programme budget outline for the biennium 1994-1995 (A/47/358), that new major programme would account for slightly more than one third of the resources under the regular budget.
The two major programmes together comprised six programmes and the Secretary-General proposed revisions to four of them - programmes 39, 40, 43 and 44.
The revisions to programmes 43 (General services) and 44 (Services to the public) related to greater emphasis on electronic support services and the discontinuation of the commemorative medal programme, respectively.
13. The Advisory Committee had not submitted detailed substantive comments on each proposed revision to the four programmes.
In connection with programme 40, paragraph 40.2, however, it wished to point out that it was doubtful whether one could assume that restructuring would be a continuing feature throughout the period of the current plan.
The reference in that paragraph to "policy direction and central leadership to the Secretariat, including offices away from Headquarters" should be interpreted as meaning administrative and management leadership under the authority of the Secretary-General as chief administrative officer of the Organization.
Those comments and recommendations had been endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 45/253 of 21 December 1990, but they had not been taken into account in the proposed revisions to major programmes IX and X. The Advisory Committee accordingly reiterated its comments and recommendations on various aspects of the medium-term plan, including those relating to the role, quality, preparation and content of the plan.
It shared the view of the many delegations which believed that the time had come for a thorough assessment of the plan and the planning process in the United Nations.
In that connection, it welcomed the proposal by the Committee for Programme and Coordination (CPC) that an ad hoc technical seminar of experts should be convened in the field of programme planning of the United Nations d/ to assist the Secretariat in drafting the prototype of a possible new format of the medium-term plan for submission to CPC at its thirty-third session.
The Advisory Committee looked forward with interest to receiving that prototype, which it would examine within the terms of its mandate.
15. Subject to those observations, the Advisory Committee recommended that the proposed revisions to major programmes IX and X should be approved by the General Assembly. (See A/C.5/47/SR.36, paras. 2-6.)
Implementation of General Assembly resolution 46/185 C: (a) Situation of the African Institute for Economic Development and Planning and (b) Strengthening of the Multinational Programming and Operational Centres of the Economic Commission for Africa
16. At the 38th meeting, the Secretary of the Fifth Committee read out a statement by the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on the question.
As indicated in paragraph 10 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/47/53), in 1991 four Professional posts at the African Institute for Economic Development and Planning (IDEP) had been financed by the United Nations through a non-recurrent grant and, at its forty-sixth session, the General Assembly had decided to provide a non-recurrent grant of $850,000 for the biennium 1992-1993 to cover the costs of those posts.
The Advisory Committee had been informed by representatives of the Secretary-General that, as a result of the 1990 review, the Institute had recast its role and moved away from traditional training to operational activities, in particular, short-term training, research, consultancy and advisory services, and networking.
The Advisory Committee had noted the efforts made by the Institute to improve its financial situation (ibid., paras. 15-22).
The Advisory Committee had also noted that the Secretary-General intended to review the need for the continuation of United Nations assistance to IDEP in the context of the preparation of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995 (ibid., para. 23).
17. With regard to the Multinational Programming and Operational Centres of the Economic Commission for Africa, the Advisory Committee recalled its comments on the subject in its report on the financial reports and audited financial statements, and reports of the Board of Auditors (A/47/500) and, in particular, its request that the necessary corrective measures be undertaken as soon as possible to resolve the problems and that the Board's findings be taken into account when proposals for the programme budget for biennium 1994-1995 were being prepared (ibid., para. 46). (See A/C.5/47/SR.38, paras. 32 and 33.)
Programme budget implications of draft resolution B submitted by the Special Political Committee in its report (A/47/614, para. 11), concerning agenda item 76*
18. At the 40th meeting, the Chairman of the Fifth Committee said that he had been informed that the Advisory Committee had no objection to the proposal of the Secretary-General that requirements be provided from within existing appropriations under the programme budget, should the General Assembly adopt the draft resolution. (See A/C.5/47/SR.40, paras. 38 and 39.)
Programme budget implications of draft resolution I submitted by the Special Political Committee in its report (A/47/613, para. 20), concerning agenda item 75**
Honoraria payable to members of organs and subsidiary organs of the United Nations
20. At the 43rd meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the Secretary-General had discussed the payment of honoraria to members of six committees/organs in his report (A/C.5/47/45).
Travel and subsistence allowances were also paid to members of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and upon the entry into force of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, they would be paid to members of the Committee established under that Convention.
** Comprehensive review of the whole question of peace-keeping operations in all their aspects. criteria for the payment of honoraria, and that the Secretary-General's report was not comprehensive to the extent of including whether such payments to other bodies in the United Nations system were warranted.
However, the Secretary-General had not been involved in the development of the decisions or the rationale for payments.
The General Assembly had requested the Secretary-General to keep the levels of honoraria under review.
He had recommended a 25 per cent increase in honoraria, since they had remained unchanged since 1981, and the Advisory Committee agreed with that recommendation.
21. Turning to paragraphs 54, 55 and 57 of the Secretary-General's report, the Chairman said that there were examples of payment of travel for family members of persons other than Secretariat staff working for United Nations organs; therefore the proposal did not break new ground.
The amount of money involved was small and it was unlikely that additional appropriations would be required.
The interest of members of delegations in that question was not related to the amount but to the question of principle and the fear of establishing a precedent that might widen the application of such payments.
22. The problem of the conditions under which some members of the Advisory Committee were forced to work must be addressed sympathetically.
Currently, the Committee required its members to be away from their families for over eight months per year, and during 1993 that period of time could be even longer.
The members would appreciate a speedy solution to an increasingly unbearable sacrifice.
Comments had been made that any member of the Committee who could not attend meetings should resign and allow another to take the position and that appointees should be made aware of what to expect.
That was not the best solution, nor was it fair, however.
No one could have anticipated that the Committee would be meeting for over eight months per year.
It had also been said that all members should be based in New York, but it was not proper for members to serve on their mission staffs in addition.
Over the years, it had been found that a mix of New York-based and overseas members was best for providing a balance.
Therefore, he respectfully requested the Fifth Committee to consider a small human rights measure to ensure that such a balance could be maintained. (See A/C.5/47/SR.43, paras. 22-24.)
Revised estimates resulting from resolutions and decisions of the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1992
23. At the 45th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the Secretary-General, pursuant to Economic and Social Council decision 1992/272 of 30 July 1992 and Commission on the Status of Women resolution 36/8 of 20 March 1992, had decided to appoint a woman as Secretary-General of the Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace, to assume responsibility for coordination of the Conference.
It was proposed to make that appointment at the assistant secretary-general level, which would result in related costs for 1993 of $166,500.
24. The Secretary-General, in his note on the restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields (A/47/753), had stated that he would present the final number and distribution of high-level posts financed from the regular budget for the remaining part of the biennium 1992-1993 in the revised estimates for the biennium.
Should the General Assembly concur with the Secretary-General's proposal, a post at the assistant secretary-general level would be available to accommodate the Secretary-General of the Conference.
On that assumption, and on the understanding that the necessary redeployment of the post would be reflected in the revised estimates for the biennium, no request for a post was being made at the current stage.
The Advisory Committee had no objection to such a procedure, subject to the concurrence of the Assembly regarding the distribution of high-level posts.
25. The Secretary-General of the Conference would need a secretary at the General Service level for the period January 1993 through December 1995, and it was estimated that additional expenditures of $51,300 for general temporary assistance and $20,000 for travel would be required for 1993.
No activities having been proposed for termination, deferral, curtailment or modification in the biennium 1992-1993, additional requirements of $71,300 would thus arise.
Revised estimates under section 31 (Public information) resulting from the establishment of seven United Nations interim offices
27. At the 45th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the Secretary-General, in March 1992, had decided to establish integrated United Nations offices in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, and subsequently, in Georgia.
In its resolution 1992/40 of 30 July 1992, the Economic and Social Council reaffirmed the importance it attached to an integrated approach to, and presence in, the region.
The responsibility for the establishment of those offices, which were to provide a unified United Nations presence and to facilitate the dialogue between the United Nations and its programmes and the new Member States had been entrusted to the Department of Public Information and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
Each interim office would have one United Nations representative and a deputy to represent the United Nations and its programmes as a whole, totalling 14 posts in the Professional and higher categories and 35 local Field Service posts for the seven interim offices.
The United Nations would provide for seven Professional and seven local Field Service posts.
28. The United Nations and UNDP had agreed in principle to share equally the start-up and recurrent operating costs for the seven interim offices, on the understanding that the United Nations share of such costs would not exceed $85,000 per office, or $595,000 for seven offices.
Furthermore, a provision of $163,200 would be required for general temporary assistance, and $176,400 for seven local Field Service posts.
In paragraph 11 of his report (A/C.5/47/58), the Secretary-General stated that no activities were proposed for termination, deferral, curtailment or modification under section 31 (Public information) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 in order to finance the establishment of the seven interim offices, and an appropriation of $934,600 would therefore be required under that section.
29. The Advisory Committee had been informed that some United Nations staff had already been redeployed on a temporary basis beginning in October 1992 to five interim offices, while two staff members were expected to establish the remaining two offices by February 1993.
Bearing in mind that there should be an integrated United Nations system approach to the establishment of those offices, the Advisory Committee was of the view that the filling of those posts by United Nations and UNDP staff and the deployment schedule should have been indicated in the budget document.
It also had problems in assessing the United Nations and UNDP share for each office relating to both development assistance and information support, in view of financing from various sources, including the contingency fund.
30. The Governing Council of UNDP, in paragraph 11 of its decision 92/43 of 26 May 1992 e/ had approved the use of up to $3 million during the period 1992-1993 from savings in original appropriations for the 1992-1993 UNDP core budget to establish temporary national and/or regional UNDP offices in the countries concerned.
An integrated budget for integrated United Nations interim offices should be submitted, with information on development assistance and information support and with complete information on sources of financing.
31. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommended that the Secretary-General should be requested to resubmit a comprehensive report on the establishment and operation of the seven United Nations interim offices, including staffing, project implementation, and an integrated budget with full sources of financing at the resumed forty-seventh session of the General Assembly (see document A/47/7/Add.16 above). (See A/C.5/47/SR.45, paras. 66-70.)
Programme budget implications of draft resolutions IV and V submitted by the Third Committee in its report (A/47/678/Add.1, para. 23), concerning agenda item 97 (a)*
32. At the 45th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the Committee had considered document A/C.5/47/69 containing a statement by the Secretary-General on the programme budget implications of draft resolutions IV and V submitted by the Third Committee in its report (A/47/678/Add.1 para. 23).
Draft resolution IV concerned the effective implementation of international instruments on human rights, including reporting obligations under international instruments on human rights, and draft resolution V concerned the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
33. Under draft resolution IV, the General Assembly would, inter alia, endorse the amendments to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and request the Secretary-General to take the appropriate measures to provide for the financing of the Committees established under those Conventions from the regular budget of the United Nations, beginning with the biennium 1994-1995.
34. As indicated in paragraph 5 of document A/C.5/47/69, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination was partially funded through assessments: in other words, only the travel and subsistence costs for the 18 members were covered by assessments.
The Committee against Torture was fully funded through assessments, which covered the travel and subsistence of the 10 members of the Committee, staffing requirements and conference-servicing costs.
35. In paragraphs 13 and 14 of the document, the Secretary-General stated with regard to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination that, should assessed contributions and/or voluntary contributions be sufficient to cover the estimated requirements of $236,800 for 1993, he intended to consult the Advisory Committee in the spring of 1993 on the measures that might need to be taken in order to ensure that that Committee met in that year, as scheduled. 36. Should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution IV of the Third Committee, then, beginning with the proposed programme budget for the biennium
* Human rights questions: implementation of human rights instruments.
1994-1995, all the requirements of the two Committees would be provided for under the regular budget.
As stated in paragraph 7 of document A/C.5/47/69, the full cost estimates, at 1993 rates, of the funding of the two Committees during the biennium 1994-1995 would be $615,000 for the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and $3,229,400 for the Committee against Torture.
At the current stage, however, no additional appropriations would be required for 1993.
37. Under draft resolution V, the General Assembly would, inter alia, request the Secretary-General to ensure the provision of appropriate staff and facilities, within the overall existing budget framework, for the effective performance of the functions of the Committee on the Rights of the Child.
As summarized in paragraph 18 of document A/C.5/47/69, the activities of the Committee on the Rights of the Child which had not been included in the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 would entail additional requirements totalling $110,800.
As indicated in paragraph 19 of the document, the Secretary-General proposed to redeploy an amount of $66,000 to cover part of those requirements.
That would, however, leave a shortfall of $44,800.
The Advisory Committee agreed to that sum and, accordingly, recommended that the Fifth Committee should inform the General Assembly that, should it adopt draft resolution IV no additional appropriations would be required at the current stage.
Should the Assembly adopt draft resolution V, an additional appropriation of $44,800 would be required under section 28 (Human rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993. (See A/C.5/47/SR.45, paras. 16-21.)
Programme budget implications of the draft resolution submitted by the Third Committee in its report (A/47/703/Add.1 para. 8), concerning agenda item 93 (a)*
38. At the 45th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the activities enumerated in paragraph 2 of the statement of programme budget implications (A/C.5/47/70) related to activities in the current biennium as well as in the biennium 1994-1995.
Requirements for activities in the latter biennium would be included in the proposed programme budget for that biennium.
39. Conference-servicing requirements had been estimated at $165,600 on a full-cost basis, while non-conference-servicing requirements of $189,600 for the biennium 1992-1993 would also arise, comprising $100,000 for general temporary assistance, $25,000 for consultants, $40,000 for travel of staff and $24,600 for travel of representatives of the regional commissions to the organizational session of the Preparatory Committee for the World Summit for Social Development in 1993.
40. It was estimated that no additional resources would be required under section 41 (Administration and management) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 with regard to conference-servicing costs.
An additional appropriation of $189,600 would be required under section 21 (Social development and humanitarian affairs) with respect to the other costs, since no offsetting reductions had been made by terminating, deferring, curtailing or modifying other activities in the biennium 1992-1993.
41. The Advisory Committee was recommending that, should the General Assembly adopt the draft resolution, an additional appropriation of $189,600 would be required under section 21 of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993, in addition to which an amount of $23,600 would be required under section 36 (Staff * Social development: questions relating to the world social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled persons and the family. assessment), to be offset by an increase in the same amount under income section 1 (Income from staff assessment). (See A/C.5/47/SR.45, paras. 38-41.)
Revised estimates under section 28 (Human rights): Centre for Human Rights
42. At the 45th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the General Assembly, in its resolution 44/201 B of 21 December 1989, had decided that additional requirements for new mandates emanating from decisions of the Economic and Social Council that were outside the scope of the perennial activities included under the section for human rights were to be treated in accordance with the provisions for the use and operation of the contingency fund.
Further, the Advisory Committee had been informed that the Secretariat did not intend to continue to produce statements of programme budget implications for perennial activities in the future since provision for such activities was included in the programme budget.
Nevertheless, for reasons indicated in the Secretary-General's report (A/C.5/47/71), projected expenditures as of the end of 1992 were expected to exceed approved appropriations for the year by some $500,000.
In that connection, the Advisory Committee recalled that an amount of $1,218,000 had been included in the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 specifically for additional activities emanating from decisions of the Economic and Social Council.
43. The Secretary-General had earlier indicated that each statement of programme budget implications and each proposal for revised estimates should contain alternatives to financing proposed new activities from the contingency fund, and that activities of low priority would be postponed to the next biennium if they could not be financed from the contingency fund.
The Secretary-General had not, however, followed that procedure with regard to activities under section 28.
The Advisory Committee believed that human rights activities should not be exempt from normal priority-setting procedures that would obviate an immediate need for new resources when new activities arose.
Further, the Secretary-General could have anticipated some of the new activities and submitted his request for new resources at an earlier stage.
44. The Advisory Committee noted that the number of human rights posts funded under the regular budget had increased from 73 in the biennium 1988-1989 to 81 in the biennium 1992-1993, excluding general temporary assistance.
In fact, it was the Advisory Committee's understanding that 93 posts were currently being used for human rights activities.
Further, with reference to the redeployment of 16 Professional posts to the Centre for Human Rights from 15 October 1992, for an initial period of six months (ibid., para. 10), with the exception of the 5 posts to assist the Special Rapporteur to investigate the human rights situation in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, the Advisory Committee was not convinced that adequate justification in terms of workload had been made.
In that connection, the Advisory Committee drew attention to section XIX of General Assembly resolution 46/185 of 20 December 1991.
It regretted that no information had been supplied regarding the sections of the budget from which the posts were being redeployed or why they were considered redundant under those sections.
45. The Advisory Committee recommended that a comprehensive review should be conducted of the transfer of posts between budget sections for section 28 and other sections of the budget so as to enable it to make appropriate recommendations.
With regard to the revised estimates under section 28, the Advisory Committee recommended that the Secretary-General's request for additional resources totalling $760,000 should not be approved at the current stage, and that the request should be justified in the context of the budget performance report.
Nevertheless, the Advisory Committee recommended approval of the resources requested with respect to the Special Rapporteur for human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, in an amount of $890,000 under section 28 of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
46. In response to an inquiry, the Chairman said that it was the Advisory Committee's normal practice to submit oral reports late in the session.
The statement on the Secretary-General's proposals before the Committee could be made available informally on the following day, but the time required for processing, including translation into all the official languages and reproduction, was such that it could not be available as an official document for several days.
Oral statements by the Advisory Committee were normally issued in due course as documents of the General Assembly. (See A/C.5/47/SR.45, paras. 99-102 and 117.)
First performance report on the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993
47. At the 47th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the Committee had considered the first performance report of the Secretary-General on the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 (A/C.5/47/47).
48. The revised net requirements amounted to $1,978,713,400, which was $38,691,800 more than the initial requirements approved by the General Assembly in its resolutions 46/186 A and B of 20 December 1991.
The net increase of $38.7 million resulted from an increase of $58.4 million in expenditure estimates and an increase of $19.7 million in income estimates.
The factors upon which the increase was based were explained in paragraph 2 of the Secretary-General's report.
49. Annex 1 showed a breakdown by section of the appropriation approved in resolution 46/186 A, including the distribution of the reduction for underutilized balances.
The annex also gave a breakdown by section of the effects of the transfers between sections as a result of the first phase of the restructuring of the Secretariat.
50. Those transfers had resulted in a net increase of $134,500, reflecting transfers of posts between duty stations, thus giving rise to an adjusted appropriation for expenditure sections of $2,389,369,400.
That adjusted appropriation did not take into account that reduction which would result from the abolition of high-level posts; in that connection, the Secretary-General stated the following in paragraph 3 of his report: "it has been assumed in the present report that the General Assembly will approve the transfers between sections proposed by the Secretary-General in his revised estimates (A/C.5/47/2 and Corr.1) but will postpone action on the question of high-level posts addressed therein as proposed in the note by the Secretary-General on the restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields (A/47/753)".
51. In paragraph 4 of his report, the Secretary-General stated that he had, in order to allow for a review of past and projected performance under all sections of the budget, set the increases and decreases attributable to the traditional factors (namely, decisions of policy-making organs, other changes, inflation and exchange-rate fluctuations and adjustments to standard costs) against the adjusted appropriation.
The Advisory Committee noted that it was for that reason that the total increases shown in the table at the end of section I and in the two tables in section II of the report in respect of both expenditure and income sections, were different from those in paragraph 1.
The Advisory Committee had been informed that, in fact, the transfers which related to the sum of $134,500 now appeared unlikely.
However, pending further action on the restructuring, the structure as shown in the revised estimates and in annex I to the performance report had been maintained.
52. The elements constituting the increase in requirements were summarized in the table at the end of section I of the Secretary-General's report.
As shown therein, an increase of $1.6 million was the result of decisions of policy-making organs.
53. A decrease of $7.7 million was shown in respect of exchange-rate fluctuations.
In that connection, the Advisory Committee noted that, as stated in paragraph 10 of the Secretary-General's report, the decrease reflected a general strengthening during the second half of the year in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against most other currencies.
54. Inflationary increases had totalled $36.9 million.
In that connection, the Secretary-General stated in paragraph 8 of his report that the increase in inflation had been partially offset by the $7.7 million decrease due to exchange-rate fluctuations, resulting in a net increase of $29.2 million.
55. Adjustments to standard costs had given rise to an increase of $24.1 million, as discussed in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the Secretary-General's report.
As shown in paragraph 16 thereof, changes in the percentage rates of common staff costs accounted for $21.8 million of the total increase under adjustments to standard costs.
The proposed common staff cost percentage rates were shown in schedule 5 of the Secretary-General's report.
56. The Advisory Committee noted that the experience in 1992 had resulted, for many duty stations, in a higher rate than had been used in the initial appropriation.
On the other hand, the rates proposed by the Secretary-General for 1993 were, in respect of Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi, Rome and Kingston, lower than the rates experienced thus far in 1992.
57. The Advisory Committee had been informed that it was anticipated that the 12-month experience in 1992 would, in those cases, result in lower rates than those shown for the nine months.
58. The Advisory Committee intended to keep the matter under review; it therefore requested the Secretary-General to report on the rates resulting from the entire 12 months of 1992 in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.
59. The Advisory Committee noted from paragraph 17 of the Secretary-General's report that, with regard to the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), a reduction of some $5.1 million was recorded in section 27 (Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia) of the programme budget under adjustments to standard costs.
The Advisory Committee had been informed that because of the difference in costs between Baghdad and Amman, salary costs had decreased considerably; however, because of the relocation of ESCWA, common staff costs had increased, thereby resulting in the net reduction of $5.1 million.
60. The rise in common staff costs for ESCWA was shown in schedule 5, where the experience for the period 1 January to 30 September 1992 had resulted in a rate of 90.1 per cent, as compared with the budgeted rate of 44 per cent.
The proposed rate for 1993 was 93.1 per cent.
The Advisory Committee had questioned the basis for that rate and had been informed that it was based on the possibility of a relocation from Amman.
61. The Advisory Committee recommended that the Fifth Committee should approve the Secretary-General's revised requirements, namely $2,447,640,500 under expenditure sections and $468,927,100 under income sections, resulting in net revised requirements of $1,978,713,400 which was $38,691,800 more than the initial requirements.
62. In so stating, however, the Advisory Committee pointed out that the adoption of the revised estimates on the basis of the structure shown in annex I was without prejudice to the further review of that structure by the General Assembly.
Programme budget implications of the draft resolution contained in document A/47/L.25/Rev.1, concerning agenda item 141*
64. At the 47th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the Committee had considered the programme budget implications of the draft resolution contained in document A/47/L.25/Rev.1, on emergency international assistance for the reconstruction of war-stricken Afghanistan.
Under the draft resolution the General Assembly would request the Secretary-General to undertake activities related to the continued operation and further strengthening of humanitarian and economic assistance programmes relating to Afghanistan currently being carried out by the Office for the Coordination of the United Nations Humanitarian and Economic Assistance Programmes relating to Afghanistan (UNOCA).
UNOCA had been integrated into the Geneva office of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and renamed the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (UNOCHA).
Activities relating to UNOCHA would continue to be funded from extrabudgetary resources.
65. Under the draft resolution the General Assembly would also request the Secretary-General to convene a conference of donor States and international financial institutions.
The related costs would be met from within the Organization's permanent conference-servicing capacity and no additional resources would be required under section 41 (Administration and management) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
66. Under the draft resolution, the General Assembly would invite the Secretary-General to continue to monitor the situation in Afghanistan and to make available his good offices as required.
At its forty-sixth session, the Assembly had approved appropriations for activities in 1992 related to the situation in Afghanistan on the basis of a statement of programme budget implications of the draft resolution subsequently adopted on 5 December 1991 as resolution 46/23.
Specifically, an amount of $6,438,800 had been appropriated for the Office of the Secretary-General in Afghanistan and Pakistan (OSGAP) under section 2 (Good offices and peacemaking, peace-keeping; research and the collection of information) of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
67. In the light of the new situation in Afghanistan, the Secretary-General believed it appropriate to streamline OSGAP and to consolidate the administrative arrangements of OSGAP and UNOCHA.
They would remain under the direct supervision of his Personal Representative, who would also be the Coordinator of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan.
For that purpose, it was proposed to provide an assistant secretary-general post from the Afghanistan Emergency Trust Fund and to reduce the number of Professional posts at UNOCHA from 24 to 16 and the number of locally recruited staff from 81 to 51.
The requirements for OSGAP in 1993 were estimated at $1,416,000.
With projected savings of $508,000 in 1992, the estimated requirements in 1993 could be adjusted to $908,000.
The programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 included no provision for the continuation of OSGAP, and the Secretary-General did not anticipate that the estimated additional costs could be absorbed.
68. Should the General Assembly adopt the draft resolution, additional net resources of $908,000 would be required under section 2 (Peace-keeping operations and special missions) of the programme budget.
In addition, $124,000 would be required under section 36 (Staff assessment), offset by the same amount under income section 1 (Income from staff assessment).
According to the Secretary-General, the additional requirements were of an extraordinary nature relating to the maintenance of peace and security, and should be treated outside the procedures for the contingency fund.
69. The Advisory Committee doubted that the proposed staffing of 14 posts for OSGAP would be fully used in view of the current operational limitations to monitor the situation in Afghanistan from Islamabad.
In view of the prevailing situation, it was unclear when the Secretary-General might decide that it was safe for United Nations staff to return to Kabul.
Furthermore, the Advisory Committee was not fully convinced of the need for consultants, taking into account that no consultancy services were required in 1992.
It was also not fully convinced of the need to provide for rental of premises at Kabul and for repair, maintenance and utilities, in view of the uncertainty of a move to Kabul in January 1993 and the fact that the Government of Afghanistan had so far provided office premises free of charge.
70. Regarding the proposed provision of $245,000 for cost-sharing of the aircraft currently operated by UNOCHA and the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) in 1993, part of that amount could be offset by the aircraft budgeted under UNMOGIP, resulting in additional savings.
Supplies, services and rental would also be affected by the operational limitations of OSGAP.
71. The Advisory Committee believed that a number of savings were possible, taking into account the operational limitations of OSGAP, and therefore recommended that the Fifth Committee should inform the General Assembly that an additional appropriation of $800,000 would be required for 1993 under section 2 of the programme budget and $124,000 under section 36, offset by the same amount under income section 1.
72. Responding to a question, the Chairman said that the Secretariat had not conducted a workload analysis of OSGAP and UNOCHA, but had accepted the Secretary-General's reasons for reducing the number of posts.
The Secretariat assumed that, if the workload was greater than the number of posts would warrant, the Secretary-General would probably have retained a larger number of posts than he was proposing for 1993.
73. Replying to other questions, the Chairman said that, as far as the Advisory Committee was concerned, if the Secretary-General found that he needed additional resources, and depending on developments in Afghanistan between January and December 1993, there was nothing to prevent the Secretary-General from following normal procedure in relation to additional commitments. (See A/C.5/47/SR.47 paras. 8-15, 23 and 24.)
Programme budget implications of the draft resolution contained in document A/47/L.34/Rev.1, concerning agenda item 36*
74. At the 47th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the Committee had considered the programme budget implications of the draft resolution contained in document A/47/L.34/Rev.1, relating to the situation in Central America, as submitted by the Secretary-General in document A/C.5/47/73.
75. The requests contained in the draft resolution, which the Secretary-General enumerated in paragraph 1 of the statement, related to good offices and peacemaking; the Secretary-General proposed to implement them in the manner described in paragraph 3.
He also stated that that would require the continuation of the two posts, one P-5 and one General Service, approved for 1992 by the General Assembly in the context of its adoption of resolutions 46/109 A and B of 17 December 1991 on the situation in Central America.
The related costs of the posts and common staff costs amounted to $155,200.
The Secretary-General stated that frequent travel to the Central American region was inevitable in the context of the Secretary-General's participation in the peace efforts.
However, it was not possible to predict the travel requirements at the current stage, and additional requirements in that respect, if any, would be met through the provisions of Assembly resolution 46/187 of 20 December 1991 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses for the biennium 1992-1993.
76. In the Secretary-General's view, the activities pursuant to the draft resolution were of an extraordinary nature, relating to the maintenance of peace and security, and should therefore be treated outside the procedures related to the contingency fund.
Accordingly, the Secretary-General estimated that, should the General Assembly adopt the draft resolution, an additional appropriation of $155,200 would be required under section 2 (Peace-keeping operations and special missions) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
Moreover, an additional appropriation of $40,100 would be required under section 36 (Staff assessment), to be offset by the same amount under income section 1 (Income from staff assessment).
77. The Advisory Committee concurred in the approach recommended by the Secretary-General and had no objection to the additional requirements of $155,200.
Accordingly, should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution A/47/L.34 Rev.1, an additional appropriation of $155,200 would be required under section 2.
Moreover, an additional appropriation of $40,100 would be required under section 36, to be offset by the same amount under income section 1. (See A/C.5/47/SR.47, paras. 28-31.)
Programme budget implications of the draft resolutions contained in documents A/47/L.29, L.31, L.32, L.44 and L.45, concerning agenda item 33*
78. At the 47th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the requirements for implementing the various draft resolutions before the General Assembly were summarized in paragraphs 16 to 20 of the Secretary-General's statement (A/C.5/47/74) and were indicated by budget section in the table in paragraph 20.
As could be seen from that paragraph, the requirements for regular activities of the Special Committee against Apartheid amounted to $438,000 for 1993.
The estimated cost of special projects was set at $567,500 and of grants to national liberation movements at $384,000.
The total requirements for 1993 therefore amounted to $1,389,500.
In paragraph 21 of his statement, the Secretary-General indicated that no additional appropriations would be required.
Programme budget implications of the draft resolution submitted by the Second Committee in its report (A/47/730, para. 11), concerning agenda item 90**
79. At the 47th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the General Assembly had considered the matter under discussion at its previous session, and that the activities referred to in the draft resolution were similar to those approved by the Assembly in its resolution 46/150 of 18 December 1991.
Slightly more than $390,000 had been appropriated in respect of that resolution for 1992.
For 1993, the Secretary-General requested an additional amount of $247,700.
The Advisory Committee concurred with that request and recommended that the Fifth Committee should inform the Assembly that, should it adopt the draft resolution of the Second Committee, an additional non-recurrent appropriation of $247,700 would be required under section 1 (Overall policy-making, direction and coordination) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993. (See A/C.5/47/SR.47, para. 38.)
Programme budget implications of draft resolution II submitted by the Second Committee in its report (A/47/718/Add.2, para. 42), concerning agenda item 78 (a)***
80. At the 47th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the draft resolution dealt with the follow-up to the eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
Under the terms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would take the actions outlined in paragraphs 2 (a) to (f) of the statement of programme budget implications submitted by the Secretary-General (A/C.5/47/76).
The statement dealt with the conference-servicing requirements of the UNCTAD calendar of meetings for the biennium 1992-1993.
Prior to the holding of the eighth session, the costs of servicing the Conference's intergovernmental machinery, the details of which
* Policies of apartheid of the Government of South Africa.
** Strengthening of international cooperation and coordination of efforts to study, mitigate and minimize the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.
*** Development and international economic cooperation: trade and development.
Since the UNCTAD calendar of meetings had already been provided for in the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993, the adoption of the draft resolution of the Second Committee would not entail any additional appropriations under the regular budget. (See A/C.5/47/SR.47, para. 41.)
Final appropriations for the biennium 1990-1991
81. At the 47th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the General Assembly, by its resolution 46/184 C of 20 December 1991, had approved appropriations in a total net amount of $1,767,318,300 - an increase of $15 million over the amount approved by its resolutions 45/252 A and B of 21 December 1990.
In addition, the Assembly had provided that a net amount of up to $13,867,100 might be committed in respect of the regular budget for the biennium 1990-1991 with the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee, a mechanism intended to enable the Committee to determine the actual level of commitments after review of any additional information justifying any such commitment.
82. In March 1992 the Secretary-General, in his report on the budget performance in respect of the financial period 1990-1991, had sought the concurrence of the Advisory Committee to enter into commitments in a net amount of $11,971,200.
The Committee had noted from that report that the final expenditure outcome included an amount of some $55.8 million in unliquidated obligations.
Based on its previous experience that up to 20 per cent of unliquidated obligations were surrendered, the Committee had not thought an assessment to be necessary at that time in respect of the commitments.
83. In order to review the necessity for an additional appropriation, the Committee had requested an updated report on the status of unliquidated obligations for the biennium 1990-1991, but the information in the status report had not convinced the Committee that its concerns with regard to unliquidated obligations had been adequately addressed.
84. Paragraph 4 of the Secretary-General's report on the final appropriations for the biennium 1990-1991 (A/C.5/47/77) indicated that of the total of $11,971,200 already committed, an anticipated reduction of $3 million in unliquidated obligations would leave a net amount of $8,971,200 to be appropriated and assessed on Member States in 1993.
The Secretary-General also stated in paragraph 5 of his report that within the amount of $8,971,200 there were several items, totalling $1.5 million, where it was already known that delivery of goods or services under the terms of the contracts would not be made before the end of 1992.
85. The Secretary-General was requesting that, on an exceptional basis, the period stipulated in financial regulation 4.3, 31 December 1992, should be extended to 31 December 1993 in respect of unliquidated obligations from the biennium 1990-1991 in an amount of $1.5 million.
Nevertheless, the Advisory Committee was recommending that those unliquidated obligations should be cancelled and reobligated to the 1992-1993 programme budget.
86. The Committee did not believe that sufficient effort had been made to deal with the question of unliquidated obligations, and, accordingly, was also recommending that the balance of $7,471,000 should not be approved for appropriation and assessment upon Member States for the biennium 1990-1991, and that a final determination of the level of additional appropriations, on an ex post facto basis if necessary, should be reviewed at the resumed forty-seventh session. (See A/C.5/47/SR.47, paras. 73-78.)
Revised estimates under section 38 (Legal activities): Commission of Experts established pursuant to Security Council resolution 780 (1992)
87. At the 49th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the Committee had considered document A/C.5/47/68, in which the Secretary-General submitted revised estimates under section 38 (Legal activities).
88. As stated in paragraph 2 of document A/C.5/47/68, by paragraph 2 of its resolution 780 (1992) of 6 October 1992, the Security Council had requested the Secretary-General to establish, as a matter of urgency, an impartial commission of experts on violations of international law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
As noted from paragraph 3 of the document, the Secretary-General had since established the Commission of Experts, consisting of five members who would serve in their personal capacity, one of whom had been designated Chairman.
The Chairman would receive compensation equivalent to salary at the assistant secretary-general level and other members of the Commission would receive compensation on an as-worked basis equivalent to the salary of D-2.
The Commission would be serviced as a legal body by the Office of Legal Affairs.
The Secretary-General had decided that the Commission would be located at the United Nations Office at Geneva and would be supported by a small secretariat consisting of three Legal Officers at the D-1, P-4 and P-3 levels, assisted by two General Service staff members.
The requirements for the biennium 1992-1993, estimated on a full-cost basis, amounted to $1,238,700, as explained in paragraphs 6 to 8 of document A/C.5/47/68.
That amount included $905,300 for the Commission and its secretariat, $26,900 in travel costs in respect of its mission to the territory of the former Yugoslavia and $306,500 in conference-servicing costs.
The Secretary-General proposed to deploy in 1993 a D-1 post and a P-3 post in keeping with the new treatment of vacancies and to use the P-4 post of Legal Liaison Officer at Geneva for that purpose.
Accordingly, no additional resources would be required in respect of those costs.
89. Since the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 provided not only for meetings known at the time of budget preparation but also for meetings that would be authorized subsequently, no additional appropriations would be required for conference-servicing costs.
Accordingly, the Secretary-General estimated that an amount of $681,900 would be required under section 38, of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 to cover the requirements for the compensation and travel of members of the Commission, as well as travel of its secretariat and general operating expenses.
In the Secretary-General's view, the implementation of Security Council resolution 780 (1992) related to the maintenance of peace and security.
Accordingly, it was also his view that the related requirements of $681,900 that would arise were of an extraordinary nature, relative to the maintenance of peace and security, and should be treated outside the procedures governing the contingency fund.
90. The Advisory Committee concurred in that approach; however, bearing in mind the small amount required in respect of data-processing services, rental and maintenance of office equipment, supplies and office automation equipment, the Advisory Committee recommended that the estimate should be decreased by $35,200.
Accordingly, the Advisory Committee was recommending that an additional appropriation of $646,700 should be approved under section 38 of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993. (See A/C.5/47/SR.49, paras. 71-74.)
Programme budget implications of draft resolution V submitted by the Second Committee in its report (A/47/719, para. 35), concerning agenda item 79*
91. At the 49th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that under the draft resolution submitted by the Second Committee the General Assembly would convene in 1993, under United Nations auspices and in accordance with the mandate agreed upon at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, an intergovernmental conference on straddling and highly migratory fish stocks.
In his statement of programme budget implications (A/C.5/47/78), the Secretary-General had estimated conference-servicing costs at $854,200 and non-conference-servicing costs at $194,600, making a total of $1,048,800.
It was anticipated that savings would arise as a result of the shortening of the sessions of the Preparatory Commission for the International Seabed Authority and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, which should make it possible to absorb the non-conference-servicing costs.
92. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee was recommending that the General Assembly should be informed that, should it adopt the draft resolution of the Second Committee, no additional appropriations would be required under sections 38 (Legal activities) or 41 (Administration and management) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993. (See A/C.5/47/SR.49, paras. 1 and 2.)
Programme budget implications of draft resolution III submitted by the Second Committee in its report (A/47/718/Add.1, para. 26), concerning agenda item 78**
93. At the 49th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that under the draft resolution submitted by the Second Committee the General Assembly would decide to convene a United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) from 3 to 14 June 1996.
A Preparatory Committee open to all States Members of the United Nations and members of the specialized agencies would be established.
The Preparatory Committee would hold an organizational session of 3 days' duration in March 1993, with two preparatory sessions, the first early in 1994 at Geneva or in New York and the second in conjunction with the 1995 session of the Commission on Human Settlements.
The General Assembly would accept the offer by the Government of Turkey to host the Conference, and would establish an ad hoc secretariat which would be organizationally part of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat).
The Secretary-General of the Conference would be appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
94. The overall cost of the Conference would be in the range of $2 million to $2.5 million for substantive and public information activities, with $3 million in conference-servicing requirements at full cost.
Conference-servicing costs of $118,400 and non-conference-servicing costs of $247,100, totalling $365,500, would be incurred in 1993.
Of those, the conference-servicing costs could be absorbed.
95. The Advisory Committee was recommending that the General Assembly should be informed that, should it adopt the draft resolution of the Second Committee, an additional appropriation of $247,100 would be required under section 19 (United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat)) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
In addition, an amount of $20,200 would be required under section 36 (Staff assessment), to be offset by an increase in the same amount under income section 1 (Income from staff assessment). (See A/C.5/47/SR.49, paras. 9-11.)
Programme budget implications of draft resolutions I, II and IV submitted by the Second Committee in its report (A/47/719, para. 35), concerning agenda item 79*
The Secretary-General stated in paragraph 17 of document A/C.5/47/81 that, should the General Assembly adopt the three draft resolutions, an additional appropriation of $2,327,000 would be required under sections 11G, 11H and 31 of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993, and an additional amount of $168,000 under section 36 (Staff assessment), to be offset by an equal amount under income section 1 (Income from staff assessment).
97. The Advisory Committee noted that, according to paragraph 8, the Secretary-General intended to place the Secretariat support structure for the activities under the three draft resolutions within the new Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development .
Proposals in that regard would be included in the revised estimates for the biennium 1992-1993 which the Secretary-General intended to submit to the General Assembly early in 1993.
That being the case, the Advisory Committee believed it unnecessary to provide funds in the full amount requested; it recommended provision for three months.
98. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee was recommending that the General Assembly should be informed that, subject to the guidelines for the use of the contingency fund, an additional appropriation of $779,300 would be required for the first three months of 1993, including $331,800 under section 11G for desertification, $418,300 under section 11H for the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and $29,200 under section 31 for public information.
An additional amount of $84,000 under section 36 for staff assessment would be required, offset by the same amount under income section 1.
Total requirements for the activities arising out of the three draft resolutions would be reviewed in the context of the revised estimates for the biennium 1992-1993 to be submitted to the General Assembly at its resumed forty-seventh session.
99. He said that the recommendations of the Advisory Committee with regard to the Secretary-General's statement on the programme budget implications of the draft resolutions of the Second Committee were procedural and interim.
The Advisory Committee had received the Secretary-General's statement that very day and had not been able to give it due consideration.
For that reason, the Advisory Committee was recommending, not a reduced appropriation, but that a budgetary provision should be made for three months.
That would enable the Secretariat to begin implementation of the requested activities.
In the meantime, the Advisory Committee would carefully analyse the request and submit its recommendations to the General Assembly at its resumed forty-seventh session.
100. The Advisory Committee was also aware that many of the programmes and activities requested under the draft resolutions were related to one cluster or more of activities to be implemented by some of the departments that were being established.
The Advisory Committee wished to review those proposals in the light of the proposal that the Secretary-General would be submitting to the resumed session with regard to the establishment of the new departments, in particular the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development.
101. While he understood that certain delegations which had taken part in the work of the Second Committee might be somewhat displeased with the Advisory Committee's recommendation, the Chairman pointed out that the Second Committee had taken almost four months to negotiate the draft resolutions and had given the Advisory Committee only one day to consider them.
In the circumstances, the Advisory Committee believed that its recommendations were fair, and reiterated that the amounts allocated simply represented interim arrangements for three months. (See A/C.5/47/SR.49, paras. 27-29, and 43-45.)
Programme budget implications of the draft resolution contained in document A/47/L.49, concerning agenda item 80*
102. At the 49th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the Committee had considered the statement of programme budget implications of the draft resolution contained in document A/47/L.49 (A/C.5/47/83).
103. The requests contained in the draft resolution, which related to the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change, were enumerated in paragraph 2 of the Secretary-General's statement, while the financial arrangements and estimated resources for implementing the proposed activities were discussed in paragraphs 6 to 18.
In that connection, the Secretary-General recalled the arrangements that had been approved for the continuation of the work of the secretariat of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to the end of 1992.
As noted in paragraph 6, resources totalling $1,176,300 had been approved under the regular budget to fund posts as well as non-staff requirements; the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and Governments had also provided staff.
104. In paragraph 9 of his statement, the Secretary-General stated that should the General Assembly adopt the draft resolution, it would be his intention to place the secretariat established by the General Assembly in its resolution 45/212 of 21 December 1990 within the new Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development.
Since the exact features of the new Department were not yet known and would be presented to the Assembly in the context of additional revised estimates early in 1993, the Secretary-General further proposed to maintain the existing secretariat arrangements. The interim
secretariat would continue to be located at Geneva and would consist of five Professional posts, one D-2, one D-1, one P-4, one P-3 and one P-2 to be financed from the regular budget.
The posts currently financed by WMO would remain available in 1993 and contributions from other specialized agencies and organizations of the United Nations system would be sought through bilateral arrangements.
105. As stated in paragraph 11 of the statement, a P-2 post and a P-3 post were available for temporary redeployment to the interim secretariat.
The Secretary-General stated that the other posts, namely one D-2, one D-1, one P-4 and four General Service posts, would be identified for redeployment from within the new Department or other parts of the Secretariat and that such redeployment would be presented in the forthcoming revised estimates.
Pending that identification and redeployment, the Secretary-General proposed to finance the posts from general temporary assistance and therefore requested a provision of $379,000, which represented six work-months for each of those seven posts.
The Secretary-General added that in the event of difficulties in identifying posts at the appropriate levels before 30 June 1993, a report would be submitted to the Advisory Committee.
106. Non-staff requirements for 1993 were estimated at $359,000, as shown in paragraph 13 of the Secretary-General's statement.
Consequently, the total substantive requirements in 1993 amounted to $738,000.
As explained in paragraph 15, the estimated conference-servicing requirements in 1993, on a full-cost basis, amounted to $990,000.
107. It was estimated that no additional resources would be required for conference-servicing activities under section 41 (Administration and management) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993.
However, because no activities had been proposed for termination, deferral, curtailment or modification in the programme budget, in order to provide additional resources for the proposed activities, the Secretary-General concluded that, should the draft resolution be adopted, an additional appropriation of $738,000 would be required under section 11F of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993, subject to the guidelines for the operation and use of the contingency fund.
In addition, an amount of $119,200 would be required under section 36 (Staff assessment), to be offset by an increase in the same amount under income section 1 (Income from staff assessment).
As indicated in paragraph 21 of the statement, it would also be necessary to amend the narrative of the programme of work under section 11F, in the manner indicated in paragraph 5 of the statement.
108. As noted in paragraph 1 of the Secretary-General's statement, the draft resolution had been considered by the Second Committee, which had subsequently decided to submit it to the General Assembly in plenary meeting for further consideration.
In that connection, the Advisory Committee had been informed that the Second Committee had been unable to reach agreement as to how to treat the reference in the draft resolution to the programme of work determined by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee at its sixth session, which had been held from 7 to 10 December at Geneva.
109. The Committee had further been informed that the estimate contained in document A/C.5/47/83 represented a maintenance level of the present arrangements in order to enable the secretariat of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to carry out its work for the first six months of 1993, it being the Secretary-General's intention to report in the context of the revised estimates on the totality of the resources required for the secretariat.
110. That being the case, and bearing in mind the Secretary-General's statement that the revised estimates would be submitted early next year, the Advisory Committee did not believe that it was necessary to provide six months of general temporary assistance for the posts concerned or to provide for non-staff items for all of 1993.
The Committee therefore was recommending that a provision for three months should be approved in respect of both general temporary assistance and non-staff items.
In making that recommendation, the Committee pointed out that should the revised estimates be delayed, the Secretary-General could submit a report to the Advisory Committee.
111. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee was recommending that the General Assembly should be informed that, should it adopt draft resolution A/47/L.49, an additional appropriation of $279,250 would be required at the current stage under section 11F of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993, subject to the guidelines for the operation and use of the contingency fund and on the understanding that the totality of the requirements would be reviewed in the context of the revised estimates for 1992-1993 to be submitted to the General Assembly at its resumed forty-seventh session.
Programme budget implications of recommendations made by the Committee for Programme and Coordination at its thirty-second session in 1992
112. At the 50th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the Committee had considered the statements f/ submitted by the Secretary-General on programme budget implications arising from the recommendations contained in the report of the Committee for Programme and Coordination (CPC) on the work of its thirty-second session.
It had noted from paragraph 11 of the first statement g/ that there would probably be no reimbursement of travel costs of members of CPC attending the joint meetings of CPC and the Administrative Committee on Coordination (ACC) in 1993 since the appropriation for travel costs had been used up in 1992.
The proposal to hold the joint meetings of CPC and ACC in the spring of 1993 had been made before the venue of the spring session of ACC had been decided; it had since been confirmed that ACC would be meeting at Rome.
The Advisory Committee noted that it had been the Secretariat's understanding that if the meetings were held at Rome it would be at the invitation of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and no additional conference-servicing costs would arise.
He drew attention to paragraph 2 of the second statement, h/ in which it was pointed out that that understanding was incorrect, since FAO did not have a large conference-servicing facility.
It was estimated that an amount of $135,000 would be required under section 1 (Overall policy-making, direction and coordination) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 for conference-servicing costs to be reimbursed to FAO.
The Advisory Committee had been informed that the Secretariat had been unable to verify the basis on which that estimate had been arrived at.
The Advisory Committee was somewhat surprised that FAO was requesting reimbursement of costs for the joint meetings, since ACC would be meeting at Rome at the invitation of FAO, and it therefore recommended that the Secretariat should make every effort to persuade FAO not to seek reimbursement of the conference-servicing costs of the joint meetings. (See A/C.5/47/SR.50, para. 14.)
Programme budget implications of installing an appropriate signalling system
113. At the 50th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that it was the Committee's view that the General Assembly should first decide whether there should be time-limits on speeches and statements, and whether that decision would be consistently enforced; otherwise, the installation of a signalling system would not be cost-effective.
The Advisory Committee had been informed that there was such a device in the General Assembly Hall for enforcing time-limits on statements, but that it was hardly ever used. (See A/C.5/47/SR.50, para. 22.)
Programme budget implications of draft decision I submitted by the Fifth Committee in its report (A/47/835, para. 78), concerning agenda item 104*
114. At the 50th meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the Committee had considered document A/C.5/47/84 concerning the programme budget implications of meetings of the Committee for Programme and Coordination (CPC) during one week in May 1993 and three weeks in August and September 1993.
The programme budget implications related to the payment to the members of CPC of travel expenses and subsistence allowance.
The Advisory Committee concurred in the estimates contained in document A/C.5/47/84 and, accordingly, recommended that an additional appropriation of $86,400 should be included under section 1 (Overall policy-making, direction and coordination) of the programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993. (See A/C.5/47/SR.50, para. 45.)
The contingency fund: consolidated statement of programme budget implications and revised estimates
115. At the 51st meeting, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee said that the Committee was recommending acceptance of the proposals in document A/C.5/47/85.
After the proposed action, the Secretary-General indicated in paragraph 3 that there would remain a balance of $11.7 million in the contingency fund.
However, during the consideration of the item, the Committee had been informed that an amount of $5.3 million was not included in the balance.
So far, all the actions taken by the Assembly which were governed by the procedures for the use and operation of the contingency fund, as determined by the Secretary-General, had been accommodated in the contingency fund.
116. Replying to a question, he said that the contingency fund technically covered three years: the first year in which the budget was prepared; the first year of the biennium; and the second year of the biennium.
The $5.3 million, which represented programme budget implications to be taken up at the resumed forty-seventh session, would be charged to the balance of the contingency fund.
There would be a crisis if more programme budget implications came up between 1 January and 31 December 1993.
If that should happen, the General Assembly would decide how to proceed; but for the time being the $5.3 million requirement could be covered by the contingency fund. (See A/C.5/47/SR.51, paras. 46 and 50.)

Bearing in mind Security Council resolutions 727 (1992) of 8 January 1992 and 740 (1992) of 7 February 1992, in which the Council endorsed the sending of a group of military liaison officers to Yugoslavia to promote maintenance of the cease-fire,

FINANCING OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE PROSECUTION OF
PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL
Establishment of the International Tribunal
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions wishes to bring to the attention of the General Assembly that it has considered a request from the Secretary-General on the financing of the International Tribunal.
The Committee's concurrence was requested under the terms of General Assembly resolution 46/187 of 20 December 1991, entitled "Unforeseen and extraordinary expenses for the biennium 1992-1993", to enter into commitments not exceeding $1,568,500, to provide for the requirements of the Tribunal in 1993.
This request was based on Security Council resolution 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, which established the International Tribunal and adopted the Statute of the Tribunal.
2. The Advisory Committee notes from Article 32 of the Statute of the International Tribunal that its expenses "shall be borne by the regular budget of the United Nations in accordance with Article 17 of the Charter of the United Nations".
3. The Advisory Committee also notes that the General Assembly has not yet taken a decision on the nature of financing of the International Tribunal.
The Advisory Committee has therefore requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on the requirements of the Tribunal to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session, based on such decisions as the General Assembly may take at its resumed forty-seventh session on the nature of financing of the Tribunal.
4. The Advisory Committee has indicated to the Secretary-General that the report should, inter alia, provide detailed justification of the number of posts and their grade level, as well as the allowances of the judges of the Tribunal.
The report of the Secretary-General should also provide information on the 93-41108 (E) 220793 /... outcome of his discussions with the Government of the Netherlands concerning the headquarters of the Tribunal and the status of voluntary contributions.
5. Pending the submission of this report to the General Assembly, the Advisory Committee has granted the Secretary-General authority to enter into commitments in an amount not exceeding $500,000 to provide for the immediate and urgent requirements of the Tribunal for its initial activities.
This commitment authority has been granted without prejudice to the decision of the General Assembly on the nature of financing of the Tribunal and without prejudice to such recommendations as the Advisory Committee may make with regard to the staffing and other matters to be dealt with in the Secretary-General's report to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.

FINANCING OF THE UNITED NATIONS TRANSITIONAL
AUTHORITY IN CAMBODIA
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) (A/47/733/Add.1).
2. Paragraphs 1 to 77 of the Secretary-General's report provide the standard information regarding, inter alia, the mandate and activities of UNTAC, the conduct and results of the elections in Cambodia, financial assistance to the joint interim administration of Cambodia, the status of assessed and voluntary contributions, the status of reimbursements to troop-contributing States, the financial performance report on the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC) and UNTAC for the period from 1 November 1991 to 30 April 1993, revised requirements for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993, cost estimates for the period from 1 to 31 August 1993 and for the initial stage of the liquidation phase of the mission and the disposition of the property of UNTAC, and the observations of the Secretary-General.
3. In section XIII of his report, the Secretary-General, in connection with the financing of UNTAC, requests the General Assembly (para. 78):
(a) To appropriate the amount of $236 million gross ($233,806,600 net) authorized with the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee under paragraph 7 of General Assembly resolution 47/209 of 22 December 1992 for the continued operation of UNTAC for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993;
(b) To appropriate and apportion the amount of $65,181,600 gross ($59,023,100 net) to meet the additional requirements of UNTAC for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993;
93-42249 (E) 040893 /...
assessments in respect of the additional requirements of UNTAC for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993;
(d) To appropriate and apportion the amount of $68,527,700 gross ($66,896,800 net) for the continued operation of UNTAC for the period from 1 to 31 August 1993;
(e) To approve, in principle, the Secretary-General's proceeding with the disposition of UNTAC property upon completion of the mandate, as set out in annex VIII;
(f) To appropriate and/or grant commitment authorization, as appropriate, of the amount of $150,515,700 gross ($147,094,600 net) and the apportionment thereof to meet the costs related to the initial phase of the liquidation of the mission.
4. The Advisory Committee points out, at the outset, that an advance copy of the Secretary-General's report in English was transmitted to it after the scheduled close of its special summer session of 1993 and that the final document and translations were not available for its consideration.
Furthermore, there are a number of areas in both the performance report and the cost estimates which are incomplete and where additional information is required (see paras. 7-13 below).
As a result, the Committee was not in a position to review the document in a detailed and thorough manner.
5. In view of the late submission of the report of the Secretary-General and the urgent need to assess the necessary funds for the additional requirements of UNTAC for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993 and its continued operation from 1 to 31 August 1993, the Advisory Committee is submitting only an abbreviated report.
The Committee will return to the traditional format of its report for analysis of the Secretary-General's proposals and submission of its recommendations to the General Assembly upon the issuance of a complete and updated report on the financial performance of UNTAC for the period from 1 November 1991 to 31 August 1993 and revised cost estimates for the liquidation of the mission.
Expenditure from 1 November 1991 to 30 April 1993
6. The savings (overruns) incurred in respect of the main objects of expenditure of UNTAC from 1 November 1991 to 30 April 1993 are summarized in annex I to the report, with supplementary information thereon provided in annex II. The Committee notes that, according to the performance report for that period, the projected expenditure for a number of items varies considerably from the cost estimates for the period.
For example, there are substantial savings under military personnel costs, air traffic control services and equipment and naval operations and large overexpenditures under premises/ accommodation, helicopter operations and freight.
The Committee therefore reiterates that the cost estimates for peace-keeping operations should reflect more accurately the actual requirements while allowing some flexibility in carrying out a mission, taking into account the financial performance during previous mandate periods.
7. The Committee recalls that substantial savings and overexpenditures in an operation should be well explained in the performance report.
For example, savings in travel ($3 million) need to be substantiated, indicating the reduction in actual travel to and from the mission area and the revised rates.
With regard to the additional expenditures for civilian police ($13.3 million), the Committee is of the view that the non-provision of accommodation by the United Nations and the reduction of mission subsistence allowance rates, effective 15 February 1993, should be well explained.
Furthermore, savings under local staff ($5.7 million) and overexpenditures under international staff ($7.2 million) need to be substantiated and justified, indicating planned deployment and actual dates of arrival of staff, vacancy rates and revised person-days for mission subsistence allowance rates, additional travel and revised fares compared to the original estimates.
8. The Committee points out that the substantial savings under infrastructure repairs ($13.1 million, or 72 per cent) need to be specified in connection with the actual disbursements from the pledges received from donors at the Ministerial Conference on the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Cambodia.
9. With regard to the Committee's recommendation in its previous report (A/47/763) concerning the question whether the commercially supplemented Military Communications System (Part A) could be further enhanced to achieve the needs of the mission in lieu of installing a massive commercial system (Part B), the Committee requests that the cost implications for both options be indicated in the performance report.
The Committee further notes that additional requirements under miscellaneous supplies ($7.8 million) and air and surface freight ($7.9 million) have not been justified in the report.
10. In view of the aforesaid, the Committee requests that the Secretary-General submit to the General Assembly a detailed and up-to-date performance report on UNTAC for the period from 1 November 1991 to 31 August 1993, including the additional requirements for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993, taking into account its observations in paragraphs 6 to 9 above.
Revised estimates for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993
and estimates for the period from 1 to 31 August 1993
11. The Committee is of the opinion that the revised estimates for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993 and the estimates for the period from 1 to 31 August 1993 are not complete and that additional information needs to be provided to the Committee for consideration.
Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that the estimates for both military and civilian personnel are based on their full deployment as at 1 May 1993.
The Committee is of the view that there is a need to indicate the planned deployment and actual date of arrival of all additional military and civilian personnel, delays in deployment (person-days), vacancy rates and related savings.
The Committee further notes that the authorized staffing table of UNTAC for the periods from 1 May to 31 July 1993 and from 1 to 31 August 1993 was not available for its consideration.
12. The Committee requests a list of the contingent-owned equipment with the depreciated value of the items totalling $338 million.
The Committee is of the view that the estimates for spare parts, repairs and maintenance and for petrol, oil and lubricants need to be substantiated.
With regard to the additional requirements for air operations, the Committee believes that, in view of the recent changes and developments in the mission area, there is a need to provide additional information on the air operations of UNTAC.
Page 13. The Committee further points out that the cost estimates for contractual services, security services, medical treatment and miscellaneous services need to be substantiated.
Furthermore, additional information is required to justify the estimated costs for miscellaneous supplies, election-related supplies and services, public information programmes, training and mine-clearing programmes.
14. Pending detailed examination of an updated report, the Committee recommends the General Assembly to appropriate and assess the amount of $85 million net to meet the additional requirements of UNTAC for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993 and the continued operation of the mission from 1 to 31 August 1993.
In this connection, the Committee recommends that the Secretary-General pursue his efforts to collect the outstanding assessments of $290.5 million due from Member States for UNAMIC and UNTAC as at 30 June 1993 (sect. V).
15. With regard to the total appropriation for UNTAC for the period from 1 November 1991 to 31 August 1993, including the amount authorized with the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee under General Assembly resolution 47/209, paragraph 7 (see para. 3 above), the Committee will make its recommendation to the Assembly on the basis of the detailed performance report for that period (see para. 10 above), including revised cost estimates for the periods from 1 May to 31 July 1993 and from 1 to 31 August 1993.
16. The Committee understands that 850 minibuses were inadvertently purchased for UNTAC but not delivered to that mission.
The Committee expects that full details of the transaction will be provided, and intends to review this issue in the context of its examination of the financial performance of UNTAC (see also A/47/969, annex VI, line 5 and annex VII, para. 33).
17. Regarding the costs related to the liquidation of UNTAC, which is scheduled to start on 1 September 1993, the Committee requests the Secretary-General to submit revised cost estimates on the basis of the detailed performance report on the mission for the period from 1 November 1991 to 31 August 1993, taking into account its observations above and the recommendations in its report on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of peace-keeping operations, especially with regard to the Secretary-General's proposals on the general guidelines, principles and procedures governing the disposition of assets for the liquidation of peace-keeping operations.
18. With respect to section IV of the Secretary-General's report, on financial assistance to the joint interim administration of Cambodia, the Advisory Committee dealt with this matter and communicated its view to the Secretary-General (see annex).
ANNEX
Letter dated 15 July 1993 from the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary
Questions to the Secretary-General
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the Controller's letter dated 9 July 1993 requesting authority to enter into commitments in the amount of $10 million for the purpose of providing financial assistance to the joint interim administration in Cambodia.
The request is made under the terms of paragraph 1 of General Assembly resolution 46/187 of 20 December 1991 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses.
The Advisory Committee sought additional information on the nature of the assistance you wish to provide and while it is of the view that such assistance could be within the overall scope of UNTAC, the Committee can find no specific authority to support the financing of this activity from assessed contributions.
Under the circumstances, it is the view of the Committee that it should not act on this question.
The Committee notes that you are making a request for $17 million for this purpose in your report on the financing of UNTAC to be submitted to the General Assembly at its resumed forty-seventh session.
Pending the consideration of that request, the Committee notes that you can utilize voluntary contributions amounting to $3 million which are available from the Trust Fund for the Cambodian Peace Process.
In addition, you may utilize, on an exceptional and temporary basis, an amount from the existing reserves equivalent to the pledges you receive in response to your appeal of 9 July 1993.
Repayment of any reserves so utilized shall be the first charge on receipts from the response to your appeal until the amount provided from the reserves is fully repaid.
The Committee regrets the procedure which led to your request and expects that you will not regard its decision as a precedent.

FINANCING OF THE UNITED NATIONS OBSERVER MISSION IN EL SALVADOR
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) (A/47/751/Add.1).
During its consideration of the item, representatives of the Secretary-General provided additional information to the Committee.
2. Paragraphs 1 to 37 of the Secretary-General's report provide the standard information regarding, inter alia, the mandate of ONUSAL, operational plan for the United Nations observation of the election and the enlargement of ONUSAL, status of assessed and voluntary contributions, financial performance report for the period 1 December 1992 to 31 May 1993, cost estimate for the period 1 June to 30 November 1993, including the establishment of the electoral component, cost estimate for the period 1 December 1993 to 30 April 1994 and for the liquidation of the Mission, disposition of assets, financial administration and observations on the ONUSAL/ONUCA special account.
3. In section XII of his report, the Secretary-General requests that the following actions be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of ONUSAL (para. 38):
(a) To appropriate and apportion the amount of $20,248,300 gross ($18,341,900 net) for the enlargement of ONUSAL for the period 1 June to 30 November 1993;
(b) To appropriate and/or grant commitment authorization, as appropriate, of such amounts, and the apportionment thereof for the period after 30 November 1993, should the Security Council decide to extend ONUSAL beyond that date;
(c) To appropriate and/or grant commitment authorization, as appropriate, of such amounts, and the apportionment thereof, to meet the costs related to the liquidation of ONUSAL, should the Council decide to close the Mission;
93-42125 (E) 280793 (d) To retain the unutilized balance of $1,813,985 in the ONUSAL/ONUCA special account in the light of the outstanding assessments;
(e) To apply to ONUSAL the proposed special arrangements as regards article IV of the Financial Regulations of the United Nations (para. 33).
Expenditure from 1 December 1992 to 31 May 1993
4. The savings (overruns) incurred in respect of the main objects of expenditure of ONUSAL from 1 December 1992 to 31 May 1993 are summarized in annex I as follows:
(United States dollars)
Military observers (98 300)
Civilian personnel costs 1 990 100
Premises/accommodation 32 400
Transport operations (345 300)
Helicopter operations 132 900
Communications 14 500
Other equipment 27 300
Supplies and services (109 900)
Freight and cartage 17 500
Death and disability awards -
Support account -
Staff assessment 200 100
Gross total 1 832 300
Income from staff assessment 200 100
Net total 1 632 200
5. The Committee notes that according to the financial performance report for the period 1 December 1992 to 31 May 1993, the projected expenditure for a number of major items varies considerably from the cost estimates and apportionment for that period.
For example there are substantial savings under personnel costs and an overexpenditure under transportation.
The Committee therefore reiterates its observation in its previous report on ONUSAL (A/47/900, para. 9) that the cost estimates for peace-keeping operations should reflect more accurately the actual requirements while allowing some flexibility in carrying out a mission, taking into account the financial performance during previous mandate periods and similar operations.
Furthermore, substantial savings or overexpenditures in an operation should be well explained in the Secretary-General's performance report.
6. According to annex II, paragraph 1, additional requirements of $184,700 under mission subsistence allowance for military observers were partially offset by projected savings of $86,400 under travel.
The Committee notes that the mission subsistence allowance rates for the first 30 days were increased retroactively from $64 to $70 effective 1 February 1992, to $80 effective 1 November 1992 and to $85 effective 1 May 1993 and after the first 30 days from $61 to $68 effective 1 May 1993.
In this connection, the Committee recalls its observation in its previous reports on ONUSAL (A/45/1021, para. 10; A/46/904, para. 10; and A/47/900, para. 15) that it was not fully convinced of the need to grant ONUSAL staff substantially higher rates than for other United Nations staff in El Salvador, and under the circumstances requested the Secretary-General to review this allowance.
The Committee points out that the outcome of the field survey which was conducted in the mission area in April 1993 (see para. 28 below) should have been explained in the report and the increase well justified, in particular in view of its observation that the previous rates were too high. English
Page 7. The Committee also questions the legal basis to increase the mission subsistence allowance rates retroactively for more than one year, effective 1 February 1992, taking into account that the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) updates the daily subsistence allowance, on a monthly basis, for all duty stations.
The Committee is of the view that following budget approval the mission subsistence allowance rates cannot be changed retroactively unless there is legal basis, which should be indicated in the report.
8. As indicated in annex II, paragraph 2, the projected savings of $293,400 under civilian police resulted from the delay in the deployment of 50 additional police monitors.
The Committee reiterates its view that the planned deployment schedule and the actual date of arrival of all personnel in the mission area should be indicated in the report, substantiating any savings or overexpenditures.
9. With regard to international civilian personnel, the Committee notes savings totalling $1,696,700 on the basis of an average vacancy of 32 personnel over the six-month period which were partially offset by the retroactive increases in the mission subsistence allowance rates (annex II, para. 2 (b)).
10. The Committee notes that projected savings totalling $52,200 under premises/accommodation were partially offset by additional requirements of $19,800 for cleaning and security services due to higher charges than originally estimated (annex II, para. 3).
The Committee is of the view that the overexpenditures for cleaning and security services under premises are high compared to the original provisions for cleaning ($9,000) and security ($42,000), including contractual services of 13 security guards for ONUSAL headquarters and parking area at $7,000 per month (see A/47/751, annex IV, para. 16).
11. In this connection, the Committee recalls its observation in its last reports (A/45/1021, para. 14; A/46/904, para. 20; and A/47/900, para. 21) and its concern that two years after its inception ONUSAL continues to pay for parking space at its headquarters.
The Committee requested the Secretary-General to pursue his efforts with the host country to obtain premises for the operation of the Mission and the accommodation of the staff without cost to ONUSAL pursuant to the model status-of-forces agreement for peace-keeping operations (A/45/594) and to report in this regard in his next report on the financing of ONUSAL (see para. 31 below).
12. Overexpenditures totalling $345,300 were incurred under transport operations due to the high level of traffic accidents, incidents of pilferage of spare parts and increased cost of repairs as well as high mileage in the usage of vehicles (annex II, para. 4).
Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that traffic regulations were frequently not observed in the mission area and pilferage of spare parts could not always be avoided in the special circumstances.
The Committee is of the view that these irregularities and the substantial additional costs may relate to a management problem in the Mission which needs to be addressed.
13. The Committee reiterates its view (A/47/900, para. 22) that the establishment of 447 vehicles at ONUSAL (annex XV) is high and the number of vehicles could be reduced in proportion to the reduction of personnel and continued vacancies in the Mission; for example, 178 vehicles are provided to the civilian administration at ONUSAL headquarters and one vehicle is allocated to each of the 38 military observers.
14. The Committee recalls its observation that the provision for vehicle maintenance appeared to be high, taking into account that the large majority of the vehicles were purchased in 1992 and that repair and maintenance costs are usually low in the first year of operation.
The Committee notes that the reductions for repair, maintenance, petrol, oil and lubricants during this mandate period (A/47/900, para. 23) are not indicated in the Secretary-General's performance report.
15. Bearing in mind the Committee's recommendation in its last report (A/47/900, para. 24), the Committee notes that the helicopter fleet was gradually reduced from six to two, resulting in savings totalling $132,900 (annex II, para. 5).
16. Additional requirements of $17,500 for communications parts and supplies, due to higher prices than originally estimated, were partially offset by savings of $3,000 under workshop equipment (annex II, para. 6); no supplementary information thereon was available.
The Committee reiterates its view that there is a need to standardize and update the unit prices for equipment to ensure more accurate and reliable estimates.
17. As indicated in annex II, paragraph 8, there were additional requirements totalling $109,900 under supplies and services for medical supplies and examinations ($25,400), due to increased medical treatment provided to military personnel and civilian police who arrived in the mission area without the required vaccinations and general supplies ($99,000).
The Committee reiterates its view that there is a need for standard guidelines for peace-keeping operations, especially what arrangements need to be made for standard equipment and services for mission personnel which would facilitate and expedite the launching of an operation.
Cost estimates from 1 June to 30 November 1993
18. According to annex III, the cost estimates for the period 1 June to 30 November 1993 total $20,248,300 gross ($18,341,900).
The Committee was informed that the mission is proceeding as scheduled; 10 military observers departed the mission area in June 1993 and their current strength is 38.
The representatives of the Secretary-General stated that the United Nations- supervised elections in El Salvador would be held in March 1994 as planned (para. 13).
19. According to annex IV, section II, paragraph 2 (a), the cost estimate provides for 353 civilian police monitors at full costs throughout the mission.
Upon inquiry, the Committee was, however, informed that as at 10 July 1993 there were only 312 police monitors in the mission area and the Secretary-General continues to have difficulties to obtain qualified civilian police from Governments for peace-keeping operations.
The Committee therefore believes that a vacancy rate of about 10 per cent should have been included under civilian police ($4,848,900), resulting in substantial savings.
20. According to annex X, the proposed revised staffing table of ONUSAL reflects an increase of 37 international and 7 local posts to the level of 357 as a result of the reduction of one D-2 post for the Chief Military Observer and the addition of 38 posts in the Electoral Division, including the Director at the D-2 level, effective 1 June 1993.
The Committee is of the view that the proposed number of additional civilian personnel and the number of staff at regional offices (36 international professional) is high, bearing in mind that ONUSAL is monitoring and not organizing the electoral process.
In this connection, the Committee reiterates its observation in a previous report on ONUSAL (A/46/904, para. 16) that the proposed establishment of new posts, in particular at the senior level, should be well justified, including a description of the functional responsibilities of new posts in the context of the overall structure of the mission.
The Committee is of the view that the summary in annex XI is not sufficiently detailed, in particular for the new posts of Director (D-2) and Deputy Director (D-1) of the Electoral Division.
21. The Committee also believes that in view of the changing scope and functions of the Mission, staff members could be assigned different functions, as required, such as political affairs, election supervision and monitoring of human rights with a view to containing the number of additional posts, particularly at the senior level, bearing in mind that the personal level or recognition of an incumbent should not determine the level of a particular post (A/46/904, para. 16; A/47/900, para. 18).
22. In this connection, the Committee recalls its recommendation in its last report that the Secretary-General review the grades of the large number of senior staff of ONUSAL, which is a relatively small mission and at an advanced stage of its operation, with a view to streamlining its structure and making it more cost-effective (A/47/900, para. 18); however, there is no indication in the Secretary-General's report that such a review was carried out and no additional information was available.
Furthermore, the number of senior staff at ONUSAL is proposed to increase from 28 to 34, including 5 senior posts for the Electoral Division (annex XIII).
24. The Committee inquired whether there is a relationship between the Head of the Division for Human Rights of ONUSAL, the Commission for Human Rights which has appointed a rapporteur for El Salvador and the Centre for Human Rights.
The Committee trusts that there is no duplication in their work programme and requests that the additional information will be provided in the performance report for the current mandate period.
25. Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that 12 United Nations volunteers have been pre-selected as external recruits for ONUSAL to perform some of the civilian functions.
In view of the positive experience with volunteers in election monitoring, the Committee recommends that the recruitment of volunteers should be encouraged to supplement the civilian staff in support functions rather than to fill vacancies.
26. Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that the budgeted vacancy rate under civilian personnel costs (other than police - see para. 19 above) for the period 1 June to 30 November 1993 is 10 per cent.
According to annex XII, as at 1 June 1993, a total of 296 staff are on board and 15 vacant posts and 44 additional posts are planned to be filled by August 1993.
The Committee recalls that for the previous period the vacancy rate had to be adjusted from 5 per cent for international staff to 26 per cent for professional staff and 31 per cent of General Service and Field Service staff due to difficulties in recruiting and assigning qualified staff to the mission area, resulting in substantial savings (A/47/900, para. 14).
The Committee was further informed that, unless it is indicated otherwise in annex XII, the civilian staff and related costs are based on New York standard costs, which are on average higher than those from other duty stations.
In view of the aforesaid, the Committee believes that there is a potential for savings under civilian personnel costs.
27. With regard to consultants and experts estimated at $74,600 (annex IV, section II, para. 2 (b) (vi)), the Committee notes that provision is made for consultancy in the areas of human rights, legal and political affairs and land distribution to assist the Division for Human Rights and the Office of the Chief of Mission.
This covers two international consultants for two months for labour and union issues and institutional evaluation and academic support ($24,000), one local consultant for the issue of habeas corpus ($6,000) and another for planning, organizing and executing the programme to issue identity documents to the local population ($6,600), two experts on military sociology ($8,000) as well as two local consultants for five months for "complex multi-disciplinary issues such as producing analyses, option recommendations, follow-up actions and producing highly technical reports" ($30,000).
The Committee was not fully convinced of the need for the above consultancies and recalls its observation (A/47/900, para. 19) that the rates are high and that a major part of these functions could be performed by the large civilian establishment of ONUSAL.
The Committee therefore reiterates its request that the Secretary-General achieve maximum economy in this area.
28. The Committee is of the view that the findings of the field survey in the mission area in April 1993 (annex IV, sect. I, para. 1) should have been indicated in the report, including a justification for the retroactive increase of the mission subsistence allowance rates (see para. 6 above).
29. The Committee is of the view that the proposed average travel cost to and from the mission area ($626,700) at $2,500 one-way and $5,000 round-trip per person is high (annex IV, sect. I, para. 2), taking into account the number of staff assigned from headquarters and the substantial savings realized thus far under travel of military personnel, civilian police and international staff for the period 1 January to 30 November 1992 (A/47/751, annex I and annex II, para. 3; and A/47/900, para. 8 - a savings of 89 per cent of the budgeted amount under international and local staff), as well as for the period 1 December 1992 to 31 May 1993 (annex I and annex II, para. 2).
The Committee believes that there is a potential for substantial savings under travel cost.
30. As regards premises/accommodation at $288,600 (annex IV, sect. II, para. 3), the Committee notes that provision is made for the continued rental of ONUSAL headquarters together with parking space ($129,300), three regional and two subregional offices, two military regional offices and seven police centres, hangars, parking space near the port for vehicles and storage of materials, a warehouse at San Salvador, new office premises and office space for the Electoral Division.
31. Bearing in mind its observations in its last three reports on ONUSAL (A/45/1021, para. 14; A/46/904, para. 20; A/47/900, para. 21), the Committee reiterates its serious concern that over two years after its inception, ONUSAL continues to pay high rental charges for a large number of premises as well as for parking space and storage (see para. 11 above).
The Committee has, in the past stated its expectation that every effort would be pursued with the host country to obtain premises without cost to ONUSAL under the model status-of-forces agreement for peace-keeping operations (A/45/594); the Secretary-General states in his report that the matter has not been resolved yet and provision is made for premises/accommodation at the same level throughout the mission until 31 July 1994 (annex VI, sect. II, para. 3; and annex VIII, para. 3).
In view of the aforesaid, the Committee reiterates its request that the Secretary-General resume his efforts to obtain premises free of cost to ONUSAL.
32. The Committee notes that provision is made for spare parts, repairs and maintenance of vehicles ($555,200) at $207 per vehicle per month for 447 vehicles for six months (annex IV, sect. II, para. 4 (b)).
The Committee points out that the rate for vehicle maintenance has been doubled from $103 during the previous period to $207 per month although the Committee was of the view in its last report (A/47/900, para. 23) that the rate of $103 appeared to be high (A/46/900, annex IV, para. 31).
The Committee therefore requests that the proposed rates be reviewed based on actual requirements in the mission area which should result in savings.
The Committee also believes that it would be useful to prepare standard rates for vehicle maintenance based on the average costs of all operations with variations according to the special requirements of each mission (see para. 14 above).
33. According to annex IV, section II, paragraph 4 (d), provision is made for petrol, oil and lubricants ($165,300) at $58 per vehicle per month for 447 vehicles.
The Committee observes that the rates for petrol, oil and lubricants differ considerably for each operation and it would therefore be useful to substantiate the cost estimate, indicating the average mileage per vehicle and the required amount for fuel with the related cost.
34. With regard to helicopter operations ($822,200), the Committee notes that provision is made for the commercial hiring of two helicopters for six months at an hourly rate of $1,142 per helicopter for a minimum of 60 flight hours per month (annex IV, sect. II, para. 5).
The Committee is of the view that the monthly hire costs of $68,517 for one helicopter are high compared to other operations.
The Committee further reiterates its recommendation that the Force Commander of ONUSAL review the proposed helicopter operations and keep the proposed requirements under review with a view to making economies (A/46/904, para. 23).
35. As regards communications ($116,300), the Committee notes that provision is made for communication equipment ($50,800), workshop and test equipment ($3,000), commercial communication ($56,500) and parts and supplies ($6,000) (annex IV, sect. II, para. 6).
The Committee observes that the acquisition of new equipment should be specified in the Secretary-General's report, including the number of items and unit costs.
In this connection, the Committee welcomes the tables contained in annexes XV and XVI on the distribution of transportation and communication equipment, generators and pre-fabricated buildings by office unit and geographical location as at 31 May 1993.
36. The Committee observes that no provision is made for audit services under supplies and services for the current period from 1 June to 30 November 1993 (annex IV, sect. II, para. 8 (a)).
Considering the increasing functions of ONUSAL and the larger budgetary requirements as well as the high level of accidents, incidents of pilferage and increased costs of repairs (see para. 12 above), the Committee is of the view that audit services should be provided to ONUSAL for the current mandate period to ensure proper financial control.
37. With regard to public information ($280,000) (annex IV, sect. II, para. 8 (e)), the Committee notes that the planned activities will be carried out in the mission area at an average cost of $46,700 per month.
The Committee observes that the public information costs almost doubled since the last mandate period although it stated in its last report (A/47/900, para. 19) that it was not convinced of the need to provide such assistance and reiterated its request to achieve maximum economy in this area.
Bearing in mind that the revised programme budget of the United Nations for the biennium 1992-1993 provides, under section 31, $111.8 million for public information, including an increase of $8.8 million, and that a large part is allocated for promotional services covering peace and security and in particular activities relating to peace-keeping operations, the Committee is of the view that these activities could be covered from the regular programme budget (A/46/904, paras. 25 and 26; and A/46/916, para. 71).
38. As regards the provision for death and disability awards ($90,000) for potential claims in this regard (annex IV, sect. II, para. 10), the Committee reiterates its view that the estimated compensation needs to be substantiated, indicating payments made during the previous mandate period and the related number of beneficiaries (A/47/763, para. 23).
39. The Committee recalls with regard to the provision of $777,600 under the support account (annex IV, sect. II, para. 11) that 8.5 per cent of the total cost for salaries, common staff costs and travel of the civilian staff in the mission area may not be fully required for operations with a large civilian establishment such as ONUSAL.
The Committee intends to review this ratio and the methodology in the context of its consideration of the Secretary-General's report on the support account to the General Assembly.
40. Considering the Committee's observations in the preceding paragraphs and the number of areas where savings can be achieved, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly appropriate the amount of $18 million gross for the period 1 June to 30 November 1993.
41. As regards the unutilized balance of $1,813,985 of ONUCA in the ONUSAL/ONUCA special account (para. 38 (d)), the Committee points out that the General Assembly, in paragraph 9 of its resolution 47/223 of 16 March 1993, decided that the remaining unencumbered balance of ONUCA should be credited to Member States against their assessed contributions for the next mandate period of ONUSAL, should the Security Council decide to renew the mandate of the Mission beyond 31 May 1993, or be made available to set off the assessed contributions of Member States for other peace-keeping operations.
The Committee therefore recommends that the unutilized balance of $1,813,985 in the ONUSAL/ONUCA special account be credited to Member States against their assessments of $18 million gross for ONUSAL for the period 1 June to 30 November 1993, resulting in assessments of $16,186,015 gross.
42. With regard to the period after 30 November 1993, the Committee recommends that the Secretary-General submit revised cost estimates to the General Assembly, should the Security Council decide to extend the mandate of ONUSAL beyond that date, including for the liquidation of the Mission, on the basis of a detailed performance report for the current mandate period, taking into account the Committee's observations in the paragraphs above.
43. As regards the Secretary-General's proposal to apply the special arrangements as regards article IV of the Financial Regulations (paras. 32-34) to ONUSAL, the Committee concurs in his request on an exceptional basis, taking into account the particular circumstances of ONUSAL and its financial status, on the understanding that the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolution 45/265 of 17 May 1991 were intended for the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) and not for across-the-board application in all peace-keeping operations.
In this connection, the Committee recommends that the Secretary-General enhance his communication with troop-contributing States so that the Member States concerned submit the relevant information and claims under the Financial Regulations in a timely manner.
44. With regard to the Secretary-General's statement in paragraph 27 of his report concerning the need for continuing financial authorization for peace-keeping operations in the event that the requirements for extensions or enlargements exceed the provisions of General Assembly resolution 46/187 of 20 December 1991 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses, the Committee cautions against such a continuous practice.
In this connection, the Committee reiterates its view that the Secretary-General streamline procedures to expedite the issuance of his reports on the financing of peace-keeping operations, thus enabling the General Assembly to take appropriate action in a timely manner.

Forty-seventh session
Agenda item 145
FINANCING OF THE UNITED NATIONS OPERATION IN SOMALIA
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary General (A/47/916/Add.1) on the financing of the United Nations Operation in Somalia.
During its consideration of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, including the Chief Administrative Officer of the operation, and was provided with additional information.
2. Part I of the Secretary-General's report (A/47/916/Add.1) (paras. 1-13) summarizes developments since the establishment of the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) by Security Council resolution 751 (1992) of 24 April 1992, including the deployment of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF) and the decision of the General Assembly, by its resolution 47/41 B of 15 April 1993 to appropriate an amount of $300 million for the operation of the expanded UNOSOM (UNOSOM II) for the period from 1 May to 30 June 1993, pending the submission of detailed budget estimates for UNOSOM II and the performance of UNOSOM.
3. Part II (paras. 14-23) discusses the main assumptions underlying UNOSOM II, its terms of reference and operational plan which comprises four phases, beginning with the transition from the Unified Task Force (UNITAF).

5. In paragraph 36 of the report, the Secretary-General enumerates the actions which appear to be required by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session as follows:
"(a) The appropriation of an additional amount of $249,732,900 gross ($245,870,900 net) for the operation of UNOSOM II for the period from 1 May to 31 October 1993 and the apportionment thereof;
"(b) With regard to the period after 31 October 1993, provision by means of appropriation and/or commitment authorization of such amounts as appropriate, should the Security Council decide to continue UNOSOM II beyond that date".
As explained in the Secretary-General's report, the amount of $249,732,900 gross represents the estimated cost of the operation for the period 1 May to 31 October 1993, i.e. $615,934,000 gross less the $300,000,000 already appropriated pursuant to General Assembly resolution 47/41 B to cover requirements for the first two months of the expanded operation, less the unutilized balance of $66,201,100 remaining in the UNOSOM account.
6. By its resolution 814 of 26 March 1993, the Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, inter alia, approved the report of the Secretary-General of 3 March 1993 1/ and decided to expand the size of the UNOSOM force and its mandate in accordance with the recommendations contained in paragraphs 56 to 88 of that report.
As noted by the Secretary-General in paragraph 56 of the report, the consequence of deciding to include operations under Chapter VII of the Charter "would be far-reaching for political, legal and logistical reasons and would entail a major financial commitment"; as stated in paragraph 101, it would also "be the first operation of its kind to be authorized by the international community."
7. In this connection, the Committee was informed that since the preparation of the Secretary-General's report (A/47/916/Add.1), the Organization has committed approximately $24.5 million for 60 armoured personnel carriers and 12 tanks to equip a contingent which was not fully mechanized in order to enable it to fulfil the actions that may be called for under Chapter VII of the Charter.
8. The Advisory Committee was informed that although the services of an under-equipped contingent could previously be rejected, this course of action was no longer always feasible in view of the proliferation of peace-keeping operations.
The Advisory Committee was further informed that the decision to acquire the above-mentioned equipment had been taken only after efforts to lease it from military sources had proved unsuccessful.
The Committee notes that by its resolution 837 (1993) of 6 June, the Security Council urged "Member States to contribute, on an emergency basis, military support and transportation, including armoured personnel carriers, tanks and attack helicopters, to provide UNOSOM II the capability appropriately to confront and deter armed attacks directed against it in the accomplishment of its mandate".
9. Apart from the implications of Chapter VII of the Charter, the Advisory Committee recognizes that the prevailing ground circumstances in Somalia have not facilitated the preparation of the Secretary-General's budget estimates, and that a number of uncertainties exist which have made precise budgeting difficult.
That being said, however, the Committee has a number of observations to make, both general and specific with regard to the Secretary-General's estimates.
10. The military tasks included in the UNOSOM II mandate are enumerated in paragraph 57 of the Secretary-General's report to the Security Council 1/ and are reiterated in paragraph 16 of A/47/916/Add.1.
11. The Advisory Committee had some difficulty in relating the military tasks of the expanded mandate to the budget estimates before it; that is, it was difficult to determine, for example, the resources that would be required to implement each of the enumerated tasks.
While recognizing the interrelationship of some of those tasks, the Committee is nevertheless of the view that an attempt to provide such an analysis should have been made.
It was also difficult to understand the relationship between the operational plan and, for example, the number of civilian staff and the amount of the other resources being requested.
12. The Advisory Committee also regrets that no attempt was made to discuss the role of extrabudgetary resources, including those resulting from the Secretary-General's appeals, in funding certain of the activities for which resources have been provided in the UNOSOM II budget. For example, although the Security Council, in its resolution 814 (1993), requests UNOSOM II to, inter alia, "assist in the repatriation of refugees and displaced persons within Somalia" and "requests the Secretary-General, through his Special Representative, and with the assistance, as appropriate, from all relevant United Nations entities, offices and specialized agencies, to provide humanitarian and other assistance to the people of Somalia ...", no attempt is made in document A/47/916/Add.1 to justify the amount of the resources contained in the budget for humanitarian assistance in terms of tasks to be carried out or to relate those resources and tasks to the programmes to be implemented through other means.
Furthermore, no information is provided concerning the contributions received in response to the appeal for contributions for the relief and rehabilitation programme for Somalia.
In this connection, the Committee was informed that thus far $130 million had been pledged for the programme; actual contributions received totalled $16 million.
13. The Committee notes that in paragraph 33 of his report to the Security Council of 3 March 1993 the Secretary-General stated that "in order to ensure the effective implementation of the programme, particularly the coordination of relief efforts and the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation, the United Nations Coordinator for Humanitarian Assistance for Somalia will be provided in the context of UNOSOM II with the necessary support in order to enable him to discharge his responsibilities."
Representatives of the Secretary-General emphasized to the Committee that the resources contained for humanitarian activities in the UNOSOM II budget related to that coordinating function and that the underlying assumption was that the bulk of the requirements for such programmes would derive from other sources.
In the opinion of the Committee, an attempt to explain this should have been made in the context of the UNOSOM II estimates.
14. In more general terms, the Committee points out that peace-keeping operations often embody a number of varied activities which, in their initial stages, enable the operation to fulfil the military terms of its mandate.
For example, it may be necessary to carry out de-mining activities or to improve the structure of an airport or port in order to secure and maintain security.
At a certain point, however, the implementation of such activities can be perceived as more rehabilitative than peace-keeping.
While recognizing the inherent difficulty, the Advisory Committee believes that the Secretary-General must attempt to justify resources for peace-keeping operations in the broader context, thereby enabling Member States to determine if those requests in fact constitute an appropriate charge to a peace-keeping budget.
15. The Committee regrets that the Secretary-General's report does not provide more precise information concerning voluntary contributions, in particular those contributions made to the fund established pursuant to Security Council resolution 794 (1992) of 3 December 1992.
The Committee recalls that cash contributions through this fund would be used for the benefit of Governments providing goods and services to troops of qualified eligible participant countries and to Governments of qualified eligible participant countries providing troops engaged in operations involved in creating a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations in Somalia in accordance with the above-mentioned resolution.
By its resolution 814 (1993), the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to maintain this fund for the additional purpose of receiving contributions for the maintenance of UNOSOM II forces following the departure of UNITAF forces and for the establishment of Somalia police.
In this connection, the Committee was informed that in order to comply with the above-mentioned resolutions, the Secretary-General has established two sub-accounts.
16. In paragraph 26 of A/47/916/Add.1, the Secretary-General states that contributions totalling $106,022,780 have been made to the Trust Fund for Somalia thus far by the Member States indicated; however, no information is provided concerning the purpose for which the contributions were made.
In response to inquiry, the Committee was informed that all but $1 million had been contributed for the Fund's original purpose.
Expenditure for the period 1 May 1992 through 30 April 1993
17. Annexes I and II to the Secretary-General's report summarize and provide supplementary information in respect of the financial performance of the operation for the period 1 May 1992 to 30 April 1993.
As indicated therein, total savings realized in respect of the gross appropriation of $108,652,000 amounted to $66,201,100 gross.
As shown in annex I, the savings are primarily attributable to military personnel costs ($29.1 million), civilian personnel costs ($5.4 million), premise ($20.3 million) and air operations ($6.7 million), all of which related to the non-deployment of troops.
18. That being the case, the Committee queried some of the overruns incurred in respect of various items.
In particular, the Committee queried over-expenditures for office and data-processing equipment in view of the non-deployment of staff.
In this connection, the Committee reiterates its observation that the time has come for an improved performance report which would provide more evaluation and analysis.
Expenditure for the period 1 May to 30 June 1993
19. As mentioned above, by its resolution 47/41 B, the General Assembly appropriated an amount of $300,000,000 for the operation of UNOSOM II for the period 1 May to 30 June 1993 to cover the requirements of the first two months of the expanded operations.
In view of the timing, the Secretary-General's report does not provide information concerning the expenditures incurred during this period.
However, the Committee was informed that commitments recorded at 30 June 1993 in respect of this amount totalled some $192,000,000.
Another $68,700,000 would have been committed but in light of events on the ground in early June, this action has been postponed.
The total of $192,000,000 does not include the amount of $24.5 million which was committed as at 5 July to cover the cost (and freight) of the armoured personnel carriers and tanks, mentioned above.
Cost estimates for the period 1 May 1993 to 31 October 1993
20. The Secretary-General estimates the cost of the operation for the period 1 May to 31 October 1993 at $615,934,000 gross; this includes the above-mentioned $300,000,000 which has already been appropriated.
Annexes III and IV to the Secretary-General's report provide a summary statement and supplementary information in respect of this estimate which comprises $182,571,000 gross for start-up and $433,363,000 gross for recurring costs.
21. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 2 of annex IV that as at 1 May 1993, the troop strength of military personnel who had served in UNITAF was 18,571; of that total approximately 1,900 troops were repatriated in early June, reducing the number of troops to 16,671.
Accordingly, a balance of 11,329 troops remained to be deployed in order to reach the full complement of 28,000 troops.
The Secretary-General estimates that full deployment will be achieved on or about 1 September 1993; however, the Committee was informed that some slippage in the schedule shown in paragraph 2 of annex IV is expected. This will have a bearing not only on the amounts budgeted for troop reimbursement but also on numerous other items that derive from or are dependent on troop deployment.
22. The Committee was also informed that the amount of $1.7 million included in the estimate for the repatriation of two contingents (see paragraph 15 of annex IV) should be deleted. Similarly, the amount of $3.6 million included in the estimate for the repatriation costs of the two ex-UNITAF contingents that departed in June 1993 (see paragraph 143 of annex IV) should be deleted. In this connection, the Committee was informed that the two contingents had been requested to remain in Somalia for the two-month period May and June 1993 but were unable to do so.
Consequently, no repatriation costs would be incurred in respect of their departure from the mission area.
23. As indicated in paragraph 12 of annex IV, an amount of $52.7 million has been included for rations.
As also stated therein, because it is expected to take up to three months before United Nations ration arrangements are in place, the arrangements used by UNITAF will be continued for the initial three-month period.
The cost per ration per day during this period is estimated at $15 per person; once the United Nations distribution system is in place the corresponding cost is estimated at $8.50.
In addition, provision is made for the cost of drinking water at $1.05 per ration day.
The Committee was informed that it is now considered that an all inclusive rate of $8.50 for rations and water should suffice; consequently the estimate should be reduced by approximately $2.7 million.
The Committee trusts that this expectation will materialize; it also hopes that every effort will be made to establish the United Nations distribution system expeditiously.
24. As indicated above, one of the assumptions underlying UNOSOM II was a civilian staff not exceeding 2,800.
The Advisory Committee notes that this figure derives from paragraph 8 of the Secretary-General's report of 3 March 1993 to the Security Council. 1/ As shown in annex VIII of the Secretary-General's report to the General Assembly (A/47/916/Add.1), the estimate for the period 1 May to 31 October 1993 provides for a total of 1,346 posts to accommodate 880 international staff (292 Professional and above, 317 General Service, 239 Field Service and 42 Security Service), and 556 local staff.
In addition, as indicated in paragraph 21 of annex IV, approximately 400 local level staff will be recruited as general temporary assistance.
The estimate also provides for the emplacement of up to 225 United Nations volunteers for approximately 3.5 months as well as for the travel and mission subsistence allowance of up to 30 government-provided personnel for a period of four months.
Provision is also made for the recruitment of up to 85 contractual technical support personnel for a period of 3.5 months.
25. The Advisory Committee was informed that it is now believed that a further 10 per cent vacancy rate would be appropriate with regard to international staff; in addition, a delay in the emplacement of the United Nations volunteers is considered likely.
The Committee was informed that the result of these decisions would be a reduction of $5.9 million in the estimate.
26. As stated in paragraph 25 of annex IV and reflected in annex VIII, the estimate for international staff salaries has also been adjusted to take into account the non-entitlement to post adjustment for staff in the Professional and above category who will be classified as mission appointees.
27. The Committee notes that the provisions for the salaries and common staff costs of international staff are based on New York standard costs.
The Advisory Committee recognizes that this was done for the purpose of estimating costs and that, to the extent that staff are recruited from other duty stations, different standards will be used.
Nevertheless, the Committee believes that, to the extent possible, an effort should be made at the time of budget preparation to use the standard costs which will in fact be applied.
The Committee also believes that the Secretary-General should receive all entitlements, allowances and duration of duty of civilian personnel serving in peace-keeping operations.
28. As mentioned in paragraph 24 above, the estimates provide for 282 international civilian staff at the Professional level and above, including 41 in the Political Affairs Division and 73 in the Office of the Coordinator of Humanitarian Relief and Rehabilitation.
As mentioned above, these staff have not, in the Committee's view, been adequately justified; moreover the totals appear high.
The Committee trusts that the Secretary-General will keep the matter under review and deploy such staff according to actual needs.
The amount of staff actually deployed will also impact on other items such as the number of vehicles which are needed.
29. As mentioned in paragraph 24 above, the estimates provide for the emplacement of a number of United Nations volunteers; as reiterated in its report A/47/763, the Committee believes that the use of volunteers in peace-keeping operations should be expanded.
Noting the provision with regard to the travel and subsistence of 30 government personnel, the Committee, recalling its recommendations regarding such personnel (see A/45/801, para. 33, A/46/893, para. 17, A/46/904, para. 18 and A/46/945, para. 21) enquired as to why provision had been made for only 30 individuals and was informed that efforts to secure the services of more such personnel had not been successful.
30. The estimate for the 556 local staff based on local salary scales applicable in the mission area (see para. 26 of annex IV) includes a vacancy factor of 20 per cent.
Provision is also made for 499 local temporary assistance staff at an average rate of $180 per person per month for five months.
As stated in paragraph 21 of annex IV, the latter group of staff is engaged under special service agreements and receives no entitlement for dependency allowances or pension, and so on.
31. In response to inquiry, the Committee was informed that the estimate of common staff costs for the 556 locally recruited staff included provision for pension payments.
In this connection, the Committee recalls its recommendation regarding application of a system designed for long-term staff members to locally recruit staff of short-term peace-keeping operations (see A/46/916) and recommends that the contracts for such staff exclude such participation.
32. As shown in annex VIII, the annual standard cost for locally recruited staff is $8,800.
In response to inquiry, the Committee was informed that for the purposes of budgeting, the middle level of the local salary was used in calculating the estimated costs.
Representatives of the Secretary-General also informed the Committee that the scale which had been used was one that had been established previously on the basis of a survey of the best prevailing conditions at that time.
It had not been revised in view of the prevailing conditions, and that no other scales were available.
Notwithstanding this information, the annual standard cost, as well as the monthly rate for staff employed as temporary assistance seem, in the opinion of the Committee, rather high.
33. An amount of $480,000 has been provided for the participation of Somali representatives in United Nations-sponsored conferences at locations outside of Somalia.
The Advisory Committee is not of the view that this is an appropriate charge to the budget.
34. The estimate for the period 1 May to 31 October 1993 includes $101,116,000 for premises/accommodation comprising $1.7 million for the rental of premises, $16.2 million for maintenance and alterations to premises, $13 million for utilities and $70 million for prefabricated housing units.
35. The provision of $16.2 million for maintenance and alterations to premises is discussed in paragraphs 39 to 42 of annex IV. As noted therein, the estimate includes, inter alia, $3.1 million for refurbishing the 15,500 square metres of building space in the headquarters compound (formerly the United States Embassy).
It also provides for the cost of the contractual services for camp maintenance which were used by UNITAF.
These services will be used by UNOSOM II for three months at a cost of $2.1 million; thereafter camp maintenance will be provided for under UNOSOM II arrangements at a cost (for three months) of $750,000.
36. The estimate of $70 million (rounded) for prefabricated housing units is discussed in paragraphs 47 to 54 of annex IV. The Advisory Committee discussed this provision at some length with representatives of the Secretary-General and was provided with additional information in an attempt to clarify the presentation of the report.
The Committee notes that the prefabricated units will provide living accommodation for 1,200 civilian staff as well as common facilities for both troops and civilian staff.
The Committee was informed that prefabricated units will provide accommodation and office space for the Office of the Force Commander; the rest of the military contingent personnel will be accommodated in tents as discussed in paragraphs 103 and 104 of annex IV.
37. The Advisory Committee notes that the estimates for the prefabricated units are not based on actual bids; consequently, savings in respect of this provision, which in the opinion of the Advisory Committee, is generous, may be possible.
The Committee trusts that the funds will be carefully administered with due regard to the need for economy.
38. The proposed civilian vehicle establishment totals 681 vehicles as detailed in annex IX; this total excludes 30 water trailers, 10 motor cycles and 5 forklifts.
As stated in paragraph 60 of annex IV, 80 of the required 681 vehicles were purchased during the previous mandate period and 110 vehicles (as well as 10 motorcycles) will be acquired from surplus holdings of other missions, thus leaving a balance of 491 vehicles (plus 30 water trailers and 5 forklifts) to be acquired at an estimated cost of $14.7 million.
39. Although it was felt that a number of vehicles might be available from UNTAC, representatives of the Secretary-General informed the Committee that at the time of preparing the report, this was not certain and that therefore the value of the 283 UNTAC vehicles which the operation hoped to acquire ($4.4 million) had not been deducted from the provision of $14.7 million.
The Advisory Committee was informed that since the preparation of the budget estimates, it has been confirmed that the 283 vehicles mentioned in paragraph 60 of annex IV, valued at $4.4 million, will be available.
It has also been confirmed that an additional 132 vehicles from UNTAC and 30 water trailers will be released.
Consequently, the Committee was informed that the estimate of $14.7 million for the acquisition of vehicles should be reduced by some $8.6 million to take into account all of the vehicles being made available from UNTAC.
40. Annex IX provides a breakdown of the civilian vehicle establishment according to vehicle type and office.
As shown therein, 67 vehicles are for the Force reserve which "may be used to supplement vehicle holdings of military contingents arriving less than fully self-sufficient." (para. 59 of annex IV). Another 82 vehicles are "pool" vehicles.
The Committee was informed that these vehicles are used for back-up support to all other areas of the operation on an as needed basis.
The Committee was further informed that the fleet is managed as one, but that for budgetary purposes the above-mentioned breakdown is established.
41. The Committee has some doubts concerning the number of vehicles which are considered necessary; it therefore trusts that the Secretary-General will review the actual needs carefully.
The Committee also questions the assumption underlying the estimate for petrol, oil and lubricants that all vehicles will cover 30 miles per day with a daily consumption of 2 gallons for commercial pattern vehicles and 3 gallons for military pattern vehicles.
42. Requirements for air operations are discussed in paragraphs 67 to 82 of annex IV. Annexes XI and XII provide a breakdown of the helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft provided for in the estimate, at costs of $36.6 million and $11.5 million, respectively.
Owing to delays in deployment, the Committee was informed that the combined estimate can be reduced by approximately $7.9 million.
43. In response to inquiries concerning air operations, the Committee was informed that given the changing requirements of peace-keeping operations, there may be more scope for long-term leases for helicopters and aircrafts and that the matter was being reviewed.
The Committee believes that such a review is needed; it is also of the view that contracts for such aircraft should not be automatically renewed without competitive bidding.
44. An amount of $19 million has been provided for communications as discussed in paragraphs 90 to 93 of annex IV. As stated in paragraph 85, an auxiliary satellite communications network, made of INMARSAT terminals will be used as the primary internal network pending the installation of a new VSAT satellite network.
Once the INMARSAT terminals are no longer required as the main internal system, they will be "useful as back-up and as communications links with the subzone offices and if emergencies arise."
45. In response to inquiries, representatives of the Secretary-General provided additional information concerning the need for the new VSAT system.
The Committee trusts that consideration will be given to deploying the INMARSAT terminals to other operations as necessary.
The Committee also trusts that in acquiring the various communication equipment, due regard to actual need will be given.
46. As indicated in paragraph 89 of annex IV, at the time of writing the Secretary-General anticipated that approximately $5.6 million worth of communication equipment could be released from UNTAC inventories.
However, because this had not been confirmed, the value of that equipment had not been deducted from the total estimate.
The Advisory Committee was informed that this equipment will, in fact, be transferred; consequently, the estimate should be reduced by $5.6 million.
47. An amount of $275,000 has been provided for public information programmes, as discussed in paragraphs 127 to 130 of annex IV. In this connection, the Committee recalls that the Security Council, in its resolution 814 (1993), inter alia, requested the Secretary-General, through his Special Representative and with the assistance, as appropriate, from all relevant United Nations entities, offices and specialized agencies, "to develop appropriate public information activities in support of the United Nations activities in Somalia."
The Committee also recalls that in his report to the Security Council 1/ which was subsequently approved by the Council, the Secretary-General discussed the information component in UNOSOM II, at the same time stating that the collaboration of United Nations specialized agencies and programmes would be sought.
As indicated in paragraph 53 of the same report, the United Nations, pending an evaluation of the evolving requirements of the UNOSOM II information programme was arranging the modalities for UNOSOM II to assume responsibility for the operation of a daily newspaper and radio station.
48. A provision of $8 million has been included for mine-clearing programmes.
In this connection, the Secretary-General states in paragraph 131 of annex IV that "the mine-clearing programme for Somalia, presently being formulated, is to cater for the requirements of both the peace-keeping aspects of UNOSOM II and the humanitarian part of the operation.
Elements relating to peace-keeping are included in the present estimates, whereas the portion of the programme pertaining to the humanitarian activities will be financed from the trust fund set up for this purpose".
49. Provision of $7.5 million for a police-training programme has been included in the estimate as discussed in paragraphs 136 to 138 of annex IV. The Secretary-General emphasizes that the budgeted amount represents the "minimum requirements for the operation of the auxiliary police force at the strength of up to 6,000 police, plus minimal support to meet the cost of restoration of police stations and training facilities."
The amount for these requirements has been included in the UNOSOM II budget because this represents "an indispensable part of the efforts of the UNOSOM military units to restore law and order in Somalia".
50. As also indicated in paragraph 138, the intention is to expand the police force to 10,000; however, the expanded programme will be financed from voluntary contributions.
In this connection, the Committee was informed that the cost of the police training programme has been estimated at $40 million.
51. In view of the Committee's observations in the preceding paragraphs regarding areas where economies are possible, as well as the reductions to the estimate as reported by representatives of the Secretary-General (amounting to $36.0 million), the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly appropriate and assess $190 million gross for the period 1 May to 31 October 1993.
This will bring the total estimated cost of UNOSOM to $556 million for the period 1 May to 31 October 1993.
The Advisory Committee believes that the above amount should be adequate for the mandate period until the end of October 1993.
52. Although the Secretary-General, in paragraph 36, requests the General Assembly to make appropriate provision for the period after 31 October 1993, the Committee was informed that, in view of the prevailing situation, a brief report would need to be submitted to the Assembly at its forty-eighth session with regard to this period.
In the circumstances therefore, the Advisory Committee recommends that no action be taken at this time with regard to the period beyond 31 October 1993.

Forty-seventh session
Agenda item 153
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General (A/47/969) which provides information on the financial performance of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) for the period from 15 October 1992 to 30 June 1993 (para. 11 and annexes I and II); the cost estimate for ONUMOZ for the period from 1 July to 31 October 1993 (para. 12 and annexes III and IV); and the revised cost estimate for the entire mandate period from 15 October 1992 to 31 October 1993 (para. 13 and annex V). The report also provides the cost estimate for the maintenance of the operation for the period from 1 November 1993 to 31 October 1994, (paras. 14-17 and annexes VI, VII and X), should the Security Council decide to extend the mandate of the operation.
During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General who provided additional information to the Committee.
2. In paragraph 18 of his report, the Secretary-General outlines the actions that would appear to be required to be taken by the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly in connection with the financing of ONUMOZ.
3. On questioning by the Advisory Committee, however, it was discovered that as a result of phasing-in of contingent personnel, rental of premises and lower prices for data-processing equipment, the cost estimates could be revised downwards.
Consequently, an appropriation of $63,943,400 gross ($61,347,700 net), taking into account the unencumbered balance of $46,867,300 gross ($47,870,400 net) 1/ is being requested instead of $66,610,400 gross ($64,014,700 net) mentioned in paragraph 18 of the Secretary-General's report. 93-42267 (E) 280793 /...
4. The Advisory Committee notes that the current mandate of ONUMOZ will expire on 31 October 1993.
Accordingly, the Secretary-General is requesting that the General Assembly, at its present session, make appropriate provision for ONUMOZ expenses for a further period beyond 31 October 1993, should the Security Council decide to extend the mandate.
For reasons outlined in paragraph 17 of the report, the Secretary-General believes that it is prudent that continuing authorization exist for the operation.
5. The Advisory Committee recalls that by its resolution 797 (1992) of 16 December 1992, the Security Council decided to establish ONUMOZ, in line with the General Peace Agreement for Mozambique 2/ for a period until 31 October 1993.
Subsequently, by its resolution 47/224 A of 16 March 1993, the General Assembly, in accordance with the Advisory Committee's recommendation (see A/47/896), appropriated a lump sum amount of $140 million inclusive of pre-implementation costs, for the operation of ONUMOZ for the period from 15 October 1992 to 30 June 1993.
6. The Advisory Committee's recommendation to the General Assembly for a lump sum appropriation of $140 million for the operation of ONUMOZ was based on the fact that with the delay in implementation of the initial operational plan for ONUMOZ it was not possible to quantify and assess the requirements of ONUMOZ for the entire mandate period.
The Committee's comments in this regard are contained in paragraphs 9 to 14 of its report (A/47/896).
The Committee's recommendation also called for the Secretary-General to submit to it by 1 July 1993 revised and detailed cost estimates for ONUMOZ for the entire mandate period, taking into account any adjustments in the operational plan and related decisions of the Security Council and the financial performance of ONUMOZ during the initial start-up period.
7. In this connection, the Security Council, seriously concerned at the delays in the implementation of major aspects of the General Peace Agreement, by its resolution 818 (1993) of 14 April 1993, inter alia, requested the Secretary-General to keep the Council informed of developments regarding the full deployment of the provisions of the Agreement, including on progress made concerning the finalization of the precise timetable for separation, cantonment and demobilization of forces, as well as for the elections and to submit a further report to the Council by 30 June 1993.
8. The Secretary-General's report on the subject 3/ dated 30 June 1993 envisages a new timetable with a cantonment of troops to start in July 1993.
The formation of the new Mozambican Defence Forces (FADM) is to begin on 1 September 1993 and this would coincide with the opening of all the envisaged 49 assembly areas.
A three-month registration period would begin in April 1994, with elections to be held in September-October 1994, after the rainy season.
However, the report indicates that any major delays would result in a significant postponement of the elections until May-June 1995.
According to his report to the Security Council, the Secretary-General is still awaiting final agreement on the timetable from the parties. English
Page Expenditure for the period 15 October 1992 to 30 June 1993
9. As reflected in annex 1 of the report (A/47/969), total savings realized in respect of expenditure for ONUMOZ for the period from 15 October 1992 to 30 June 1993 are $46,867,300 gross ($47,870,400 net).
The Committee was informed that the savings under objects of expenditure such as contingent personnel costs ($2,602,400), civilian personnel costs ($4,677,100), prefabricated housing units ($21,172,600), infrastructure repairs ($4,470,000), transport operations ($1,463,000), air operations ($1,848,300), communications ($5,758,600), and programmes related to former combatants in the assembly areas ($2,500,000) were mostly attributable to the delay in the start-up of the operation.
10. The Advisory Committee was also informed that expenditure over-runs relating to rental of premises ($740,200) were due to the extreme shortage of adequate accommodation; and $143,500 for landing fees and ground handling for air operations were due to the absence of a status of forces agreement on ONUMOZ which was only signed on 14 May 1993.
The existence of such an agreement would, for the future, not only enable freedom of movement of contingent and civilian personnel, but also eliminate customs duties and take-off and landing fees which have up to now been levied on the operation by the authorities.
Cost estimates for the period from 1 July to 31 October 1993
11. The cost estimates for the above period provide for a total of 354 military observers, 6,625 military contingent personnel, 355 civilian personnel and 506 local staff as indicated in annexes IV and IX of the report.
12. The Committee was informed that as at 21 June 1993, of the total military personnel budgeted for, 251 military observers and 5,946 military personnel were in the mission area.
The Committee was also informed that, owing to the phasing-in of contingent personnel, the related costs involved which are shown in annex III as $54,036,100 can be revised to $52,256,000.
Consequently, related adjustments need to be made against such items of expenditure applicable to contingent personnel as standard troop cost reimbursement ($28,012,800), welfare ($367,700), rations ($5,430,400), and daily allowance ($993,000).
13. With regard to the civilian staffing component, the Committee notes that "owing to delays in the deployment of civilian staff, the costs for international staff include a 33 per cent vacancy factor and the costs for locally recruited staff include a 56 per cent vacancy factor" (annex IV, para. 8).
Based on the information provided to it, the Advisory Committee believes that a considerably higher vacancy factor should be taken into account in calculating these costs for the period from 1 July to 31 October 1993.
14. That being said, the Committee would like to point out that in its report to the General Assembly (A/47/896), the Committee had not made any specific recommendations on the proposed civilian staffing for ONUMOZ.
The Advisory Committee questions the need for an international civilian component of 355 personnel including 142 General Service staff.
The Committee recommends that the possibility of utilizing locally recruited personnel for secretarial, clerical and related functions be thoroughly explored with a view to achieving savings without affecting the level of efficiency.
15. The Committee notes from annex II (para. 80) of the Secretary-General's report that an amount of $3,500,000 was expended during the period from 15 October 1992 to 30 June 1993 on programmes related to former combatants in the assembly areas and that an additional amount of $7,500,000 will be required during the period from 1 July to 31 October 1993.
The estimate provides for the assistance that ONUMOZ, under the United Nations Office for Humanitarian Assistance Coordination and the International Organization for Migration, will provide to former combatants under the demobilization programme.
In this connection, the Advisory Committee reiterates its view that there is a need to define clearly the role of assessed budgets for humanitarian activities.
16. The Advisory Committee also points out that the Secretary-General's report does not provide precise information with regard to voluntary contributions and other Trust Fund resources and expects that future submissions will contain this information so that the Committee is able to obtain a clearer picture of activities that are charged to these resources vis-à-vis assessed resources.
17. The Advisory Committee was informed that the charges for monthly rental of premises which had been erroneously reported as $346,797 (annex XI) have now been revised to $245,750 per month.
Thus the estimated costs of $1,387,200 for rental of premises for the period 1 July to 31 October 1993 as reflected in annex III can be revised to $983,000.
Notwithstanding this revision, the Advisory Committee trusts that every effort will be made to seek the Government's assistance in procuring warehouse and office space with minimum charge to the United Nations.
18. The Committee was informed that, since the preparation of the Secretary-General's report, more accurate and recent information with regard to prices for data-processing equipment has become available, thus reducing the total estimated cost as shown in annex III from $500,500 to $17,800.
In this connection, the Committee notes that an amount of $2,225,000 was expended for data-processing equipment during the period from 15 October 1992 to 30 June 1993 and that the additional amount of $17,800 would be required during the period from 1 July to 31 October 1993 to complete the acquisition of data-processing equipment.
19. As stated in annex IV (para. 36), an increase in the number of minibuses required (from 11 to 111) is due to fewer contingent-owned vehicles arriving in the mission area than originally anticipated.
The Committee notes that the additional 100 new minibuses will be obtained from the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) and that the cost estimate provides for their purchase price plus related freight charges ($1,058,000); this amount would be credited to the appropriate UNTAC account.
The Advisory Committee points out that Member States have already been charged for the vehicles and therefore it is not appropriate for them to be charged for the same items again even if the charge would be at depreciated rates and even though that charge would be a credit to UNTAC.
In this connection, the Committee recalls its observation in the context of its reports on the financing of the missions in El Salvador and Angola (A/46/904, paras. 8 and 9 and A/46/945, para. 27).
20. The Advisory Committee notes that an amount of $1,243,500 is estimated during the period to complete the acquisition of vehicles.
However, in this connection the Committee notes from annex VI (para. 5) and annex VII (para. 33) that for the period beyond 31 October 1993 provision of another $1,058,000 has been made for the purchase of an additional 100 minibuses from UNTAC.
This would bring the total minibus fleet to 211.
21. The Committee understands that these minibuses are part of the 850 minibuses that were inadvertently purchased for UNTAC but not delivered to that mission.
The Committee expects that full details of the transaction will be provided, and intends to review this issue in the context of its examination of the financial performance of UNTAC.
22. From the information provided to it, the Advisory Committee believes that the number of vehicles proposed is excessive not only in terms of ratio and distribution of vehicles to personnel but also in terms of suitability of vehicles such as light sedans to traverse inaccessible and inhospitable terrain.
23. On inquiry as to the high cost of petrol ($3.25 per gallon), the Committee was informed that negotiations are under way to obtain bulk purchases, and taking into account the expectation that future purchases would be excluded from all taxes and duties (see para. 10 above), a substantial reduction in the cost is anticipated.
24. With regard to general purchase of materials and services, the Advisory Committee reiterates its recommendation that whenever cost-effective and technically feasible, every reasonable effort should be made by the Secretariat, in accordance with established procurement procedures, to acquire services, resources and materials from local area sources (A/47/896, para. 13).
25. With regard to the mine-clearing programme, the Advisory Committee attempted to seek additional clarification as to the proportion of expenditure envisaged from the ONUMOZ budget vis-à-vis voluntary contributions.
The Committee was informed that of the $11 million reflected in the report (annex V, para. 11), $7 million had been expended in road clearing and building contracts and the additional $4 million being requested for the period 1 July to 31 October provided for the establishment of a de-mining training school (annex IV, para. 79).
The Advisory Committee was also informed that an additional amount of approximately $7.8 million has been made available for this purpose through voluntary contributions.
26. In view of its observations and taking into account the adjustments made by the Secretariat and referred to in the paragraphs above, the Committee recommends that an amount of $54 million gross be appropriated and assessed for the period from 1 July 1993 to 31 October 1993.
On this basis, commitment authority, with the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee, of up to $20 million gross per month could be granted for the period beyond 31 October 1993 should the Security Council extend the mandate of ONUMOZ beyond that date.
The Advisory Committee would consider any such request for commitment on the basis, inter alia, of a report on developments on the ONUMOZ timetable.

FINANCING OF THE UNITED NATIONS PROTECTION FORCE
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the addendum to the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) (A/47/741/Add.1 and Corr.1).
During its consideration of the item, representatives of the Secretary-General provided additional information to the Committee.
2. Paragraphs 1 to 49 of the Secretary-General's report provide the standard information regarding, inter alia, the mandate of UNPROFOR, its enlargements and operational plan, status of assessed contributions, voluntary contributions, financial administration, financing of the Force for the period 21 February to 31 March 1993, financial performance report for the period from 12 January 1992 to 31 March 1993, cost estimates for the period from 1 April to 30 June 1993 and for the additional start-up requirements for the expansions of the Force, cost estimate for the period from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1994 and status of reimbursement to troop-contributing States.
3. In paragraph 50 of his report, the Secretary-General requests that the following actions be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNPROFOR:
(a) To extend the first financial period to 31 March 1993 and to consolidate and administer the resources provided to UNPROFOR for the period from its inception to 31 March 1993;
(b) To appropriate $27,759,900 gross ($27,269,300 net) authorized with the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee under General Assembly resolution 47/210 for the maintenance of UNPROFOR for the period from 21 February to 31 March 1993;
93-43100 (E) 030893 /...
concurrence of the Advisory Committee for maintaining UNPROFOR for the period from 1 April to 30 June 1993;
(d) To appropriate and apportion the amount of $79,137,400 to meet the additional start-up requirements for the enlargements of UNPROFOR in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina;
(e) To appropriate and/or grant commitment authorization of such additional amounts, as appropriate, for the period after 30 June 1993;
(f) To establish the special financial period of UNPROFOR for 12 months, effective 1 July 1993, subject to the continuation of UNPROFOR by the Security Council;
(g) To apply to UNPROFOR the proposed special arrangements as regards article IV of the Financial Regulations of the United Nations (A/47/741/Add.1, para. 23).
Expenditure from 12 January 1992 to 31 March 1993
4. The savings (overruns) incurred in respect of the main objects of expenditure of UNPROFOR from its inception to 31 March 1993 are summarized in annex I to the report as follows:
US dollars Military personnel costs 4 268 700
Civilian police monitors 977 100
Civilian staff costs (180 600)
Premises/accommodation 3 391 000
Air operations 147 000
Transport operations (4 316 200)
Communications (2 546 900)
Other equipment (2 779 600)
Supplies and services 1 202 000
Freight and cartage (162 500)

Net total -
5. The Advisory Committee notes that the substantial savings under military personnel costs are due to the high vacancy rate of military observers in the mission area ($754,900) and savings under troop reimbursements ($3,821,000), rations ($1,936,100) and daily allowance ($260,700) owing to the lower number of troop months served which were partially offset by additional requirements for clothing and equipment allowance ($661,800), welfare ($283,200), mission subsistence allowance ($23,700) and travel ($1,535,300) (annex II, paras. 1-5).
6. The Committee points out that savings and overexpenditures should be fully substantiated in the financial performance reports on peace-keeping operations.
For example, the Committee was not able to assess the overexpenditures for travel of military personnel ($1.5 million) without additional information.
In this connection, the Committee was informed that the additional requirements for travel were due to the emplacement of troops through commercial air carriers rather than troop contributors. English Page
7. The Committee points out that no supplementary information has been provided with regard to the smaller number of civilian police monitors in the mission area and related savings ($977,100), additional requirements for travel of civilian staff ($605,500) or savings for mission subsistence allowance (MSA) and for local staff ($424,900) (annex II, paras. 7 and 8).
Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that the additional travel costs for civilian staff were due to more frequent travel for ongoing consultations and preventive diplomacy.
8. The Committee notes that savings totalling $4,316,400 were made under rental of premises, maintenance services, utilities and prefabricated buildings which were partially offset by additional requirements of $925,400 for renovation of premises and maintenance supplies (annex II, para. 9).
According to annex II, paragraph 13, plans for the acquisition of additional prefabricated units and construction projects were postponed owing to the uncertainty of renewing UNPROFOR's mandate.
The Committee understands that more accommodation facilities were available in the mission area and at lower cost than initially estimated.
9. According to annex II, paragraphs 14 and 15 of the report, changes in the number of aircraft and configuration of the air fleet resulted in savings ($926,700), which were partially offset by additional requirements ($779,700).
The Committee points out that changes in air operations should be specified in the financial performance report, indicating the planned and actual scope of operations in the mission area, number and type of aircraft, date of actual deployment, flying hours, hire/charter costs, insurance, ground handling and allowances for air crew.
10. The Committee further notes that no supplementary information was provided with regard to the need for overexpenditures under communications ($2,546,900) and other equipment ($2,779,600) (annex II, paras. 18 and 19).
11. While reiterating the need for adequate information and analysis on performance, the Committee recommends that the General Assembly appropriate the amount of $27,759,900 gross ($27,269,300 net), authorized with the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee under paragraph 7 of Assembly resolution 47/210, for the maintenance of UNPROFOR for the period from 21 February to 31 March 1993.
12. The Committee notes the information provided in paragraph 20 of the report concerning the Trust Fund for the Common Costs of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Command covering the additional United Nations administrative expenses related to the enlargement of UNPROFOR to provide protection to humanitarian relief convoys.
The Committee points out that there is a need to provide more information on the expenditure incurred by the Fund and that the balance as at 31 March 1993 and any subsequent contributions to the Fund should be reflected in the next performance report.
Cost estimates from 1 April to 30 June 1993
13. The cost estimates for the above period provide for a total average of 23,224 military personnel (17,842 troops, 4,982 logistic/support personnel and 400 military observers) out of an authorized strength of 24,628 (annex VIII), 630 civilian police monitors, 510 international civilian staff and 859 local staff (annex V, paras. 6-8); explanatory notes on the basis for the estimated civilian staff costs are indicated in annex V, paragraph 9. The Committee is of the view that, taking into account the difficulties and delays in the deployment of troops in the mission area (see para. 14 below) and the budgeted military strength of about 95 per cent, there is a potential for savings.
14. With regard to the provision of $70.6 million for standard troop cost reimbursement (annex V, para. 16), the Secretary-General points out that UNPROFOR has been unable to meet its obligations on a current basis to troop-contributing countries owing to considerable delays in payments of assessed contributions by some Member States (A/47/741/Add.1, para. 48).
The Committee was informed that as at 30 June 1993 the amount due to troop-contributing States totalled $102.6 million and that it had not been possible to reimburse troop contributors since October 1992 owing to lack of resources.
The representatives of the Secretary-General pointed out the great difficulty in retaining or increasing troops in peace-keeping operations because of the increasingly long delays in reimbursing troop-contributing countries.
15. According to annex V, paragraph 2, mission subsistence allowance will be paid to all military observers, civilian police monitors and international civilian staff at $150 per person per day for the first 30 days, $120 per day thereafter in Bosnia and Herzegovina and $110 per day thereafter in all other locations of the mission area.
Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that as a result of the review of the MSA rates and the Committee's observations in its first report on UNPROFOR (A/46/893, para. 11), the rate was reduced by $10 for the period after 30 days in the mission area.
The Committee recommends that the MSA rate at UNPROFOR be kept under review to ensure that it is not substantially higher than the average per diem applicable to all other eligible staff in the mission area.
16. According to annex V, paragraph 10, the civilian staff costs include a vacancy factor of 40 per cent for international civilian staff and of 25 per cent for local staff.
In view of the large vacancy rate at UNPROFOR, the Advisory Committee is of the view that it would have been useful to indicate in the report the average number and duration of vacancies of international and local staff since inception of the mission and to explain the estimated vacancy factor for this period.
The Committee was informed that the actual vacancy rate of international civilian staff is 44 per cent.
Considering that almost half of the international posts at UNPROFOR remain vacant, the Committee believes that it may be more cost-effective and practical to discontinue a number of established posts rather than to include a 40 per cent vacancy factor in the budget estimates.
17. The Committee notes that the cost estimates provide for the employment of 216 international personnel on a contractual basis ($2,067,400) at an average cost of $3,545 per person per month, including food allowance and rent, taking into account a 10 per cent vacancy factor (annex V, paras. 11 and 34).
Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that, in view of the high vacancy rate of international civilian and local personnel in the mission area, international personnel (mainly technical staff) were being contracted through agencies based on the lowest offers through international bidding procedures.
It is proposed to increase the number of international contractual personnel from 216 to 586 for the period starting 1 July 1993, including 345 personnel for convoy protection (annex IX). The Committee was further informed that the contractors pay the contracted staff directly for their services at sometimes different rates for the same work; such personnel were usually teams experienced in fieldwork and suitable to serve in peace-keeping operations, except leadership positions.
18. The Committee is of the view that in missions where the United Nations is required to contract personnel to perform certain functions, the rates should be based on the nature of the services provided and not on the pay standards of the country of origin.
The Committee notes that the United Nations should ensure compliance with the principle of equal pay for equal work and that it would be useful to establish safeguards against the possibility of abuse and the exploitation of vulnerable groups by contractors.
19. Considering the positive experience with volunteers in election monitoring as a cost-effective and efficient contribution to peace-keeping, the Committee reiterates its recommendation that the use of volunteers in peace-keeping operations should be expanded (A/47/763, para. 49).
Furthermore, the Committee recalls its recommendation that, in operations with a large civilian component such as UNPROFOR, it would be useful to request Member States to provide additional qualified civilian personnel to carry out non-core functions, thus reducing the costs of particularly large operations and containing the use of the limited resources of the Secretariat (see A/45/801, para. 33; A/46/893, para. 17; A/46/904, para. 18; A/46/945, para. 21).
20. The cost estimates provide for death and disability compensation in the amount of $3,450,000 (annex V, para. 23); no additional information has been provided for the basis of this provision.
The Committee reiterates its view that the estimated compensation needs to be substantiated, indicating payments made during the previous mandate period and the related number of beneficiaries (see A/47/763, para. 23).
21. The Committee notes that provision of $21.4 million is made for payment to troop-contributing countries for contingent-owned equipment (annex V, para. 24); no additional information has been provided.
The Committee reiterates that the list of contingent-owned equipment and the related value should be known and be provided to the Committee to enable it to assess the estimated costs for reimbursement, taking into account the substantial amount involved.
In this connection, the representatives of the Secretary-General indicated the considerable delays in the submission of relevant information from Governments to reimburse the costs.
Furthermore, the United Nations does not have the capability to evaluate such equipment and needs to obtain the expertise of Governments.
In view of the foregoing, the Committee believes that there is a need to simplify the current procedures to expedite such reimbursement.
22. The costs for premises/accommodation for the three-month period from 1 April to 30 June 1993 are estimated at $10.6 million (annex V, paras. 35-42), excluding start-up requirements for the expansion of UNPROFOR (annex VI). Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that the mission was required to enhance accommodation facilities which were previously provided free of cost.
The Committee recalls its observations in its first report on UNPROFOR (A/46/893, para. 19) and is of the view that the estimated costs for premises and accommodation are high.
23. According to annexes IV and V to the report, the estimated requirements for air operations for the three-month period amount to $8,549,400.
The Committee was informed that the air operations for UNPROFOR were procured and contracted at Headquarters and in this respect there was no procurement delegation to the mission.
The Committee was further informed that in view of the relatively large number of accidents in the mission area, only certified operators would henceforth be considered; however, the revised operating procedures and higher safety standards would increase the costs for air operations.
The costs for insurance under air operations are indicated in annex XI.
24. With regard to transport operations ($21,053,400), the Committee notes that provision is made for the initial rental of 70 transport vehicles ($1,458,600).
The Committee is of the view that proper planning and early acquisition of vehicles would reduce the need for initial rental of vehicles and result in savings.
The Committee further believes that the provision for spare parts, repairs and maintenance of vehicles for three months ($7,146,700) at an annual rate of $1,000 for 1,058 United Nations-owned vehicles and at $5,000 for 6,141 contingent-owned vehicles is high (annex V, paras. 58 and 59).
25. The costs for other equipment are estimated at $1,200,000 and for supplies and services at $8,728,600 (annex V, paras. 67-82).
The Committee points out that no provision is made under audit services for this period (ibid., para. 69).
Considering the magnitude of UNPROFOR and the estimated substantial costs, the Committee is of the view that audit services should have been provided to UNPROFOR for the period from 1 April to 30 June 1993 to ensure proper financial control.
26. As regards medical supplies ($1,200,000) at $400,000 per month (annex V, para. 79), in addition to medical services ($75,000) at $25,000 per month (ibid., para. 73), the Committee was informed that assistance to the local population is not provided by UNPROFOR.
27. With regard to the provision of $906,500 under the support account for peace-keeping operations (annex V, para. 84), the Committee refers to its observations in its first report on UNPROFOR (A/46/893, para. 28), namely, that 8.5 per cent of the total cost of salaries, common staff costs and travel of the civilian staff in the mission area may not be fully required, considering the large civilian establishment of UNPROFOR.
The Committee intends to review this ratio in the context of its consideration of the Secretary-General's proposals on the support account in his report to the General Assembly.
28. The Committee recommends that the General Assembly appropriate the amount of $227,584,900 gross ($226,132,800 net), inclusive of the amount of $141,193,575 gross ($139,477,002 net) authorized with the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee under paragraph 7 of General Assembly resolution 47/210 and $10 million authorized by the Advisory Committee under paragraph 1 of General Assembly resolution 46/187 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses for the biennium 1992-1993, and assess the amount of $86,391,325 gross ($86,655,798 net) 1/ for the maintenance of UNPROFOR for the period from 1 April to 30 June 1993.
Cost estimates of the additional start-up requirements for the expansion of UNPROFOR
29. The additional start-up requirements in connection with the expanded operations of UNPROFOR in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina covering the renovation of premises, acquisition of prefabricated units, transportation, communications and other equipment are estimated at $79,137,400 (A/47/741/Add.1, para. 40).
In this connection, the Committee understands that the above estimates, including the proposed arrangements in respect of the safe areas, may be subject to change depending on new developments in the mission area.
30. Provision of $25.9 million has been made for the construction of prefabricated buildings in Bosnia and Herzegovina to accommodate 5,000 personnel (annex VI, para. 10).
The Committee is of the view that the estimated costs for premises, especially prefabricated buildings at a unit cost of $4,500 for accommodation, $9,500 for ablution units and $1,000 for kitchen/dining facilities, excluding accommodation equipment estimated at $3.2 million (ibid., para. 39), are high, taking into account the substantial savings during the initial mandate period (see para. 8 above).
The Committee further believes that there may be no need to provide accommodation for 5,000 additional personnel in the mission area and that there is a potential for substantial savings under this item.
31. With regard to transport operations, provision of $16.8 million is made for the purchase of 39 additional vehicles for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 343 vehicles for convoy protection in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 20 armoured jeeps for the safe areas (annex VI, para. 12); the type of vehicles and the unit costs are indicated in annex XII and the proposed total vehicle establishment in annex XVIII.
32. The Committee believes that it would have been useful to provide a breakdown of the proposed allocation of additional vehicles per staff in the various units and areas in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Considering the proposed large total number of 1,637 vehicles compared to a vacancy rate of over 40 per cent for international civilian staff and 25 per cent for local staff (see para. 16 above) and the substantial costs involved, the Committee believes that there is a potential for savings.
The Committee further notes that in view of the high unit costs of $150,000 for one armoured jeep (annex XII), the Secretary-General may wish to invite Member States to provide such vehicles to UNPROFOR at preferential rates or on loan with a view to reducing the costs of large operations.
33. The estimated requirements under communications for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ($2,879,000), convoy protection in Bosnia and Herzegovina ($6,986,600) and safe areas ($816,500), totalling $10,682,100, are described in annex VI, paragraphs 18 to 31, with related cost estimates in annex XIII of the report.
The estimated requirements for other equipment, including office equipment ($1,219,700), data-processing equipment ($1,842,000), accommodation equipment ($3,171,000) and generators ($8,324,400), totalling $19,816,900, are indicated in annex VI, paragraphs 35 to 48 and related cost estimates in annexes XIV to XVII. The Committee is of the view that the cost estimates for the above equipment are high and that economies can be made.
For example, the unit costs for a laptop computer and printer are estimated at $3,900 (annex XVI), considerably above the commercial rates for standard equipment.
34. In this connection, the Committee reiterates the need to ensure that the acquisition of equipment is compatible with the needs of the mission (A/45/1005, para. 18).
Furthermore, the Committee recalls that the proposed equipment should not be more sophisticated than required for the operation, based on normal standards and actual needs, taking into account the local environment (A/46/893, para. 26; A/46/904, para. 24; A/46/916, para. 62; A/46/945, para. 31).
35. Considering the Committee's observations in paragraphs 29 to 34 above and the number of areas where savings can be achieved, especially under premises/accommodation, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly appropriate and assess the amount of $55 million gross to meet the additional start-up requirements for the enlargements of UNPROFOR in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Cost estimates from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1994
36. According to annex IV of the report, the total costs for the 12-month period from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1994 are estimated at $924,785,400 gross ($917,816,700 net); the estimated monthly cost of maintaining UNPROFOR for the above period amounts to $77,065,450 gross ($76,484,725 net), excluding non-recurring costs for start-up items required in connection with the expansions in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (A/47/741/Add.1, para. 42).
Considering the substantial additional requirements related to the full implementation of a number of Security Council resolutions 2/ for which cost estimates have not been submitted yet to the Advisory Committee and any possible future modifications and expansions of UNPROFOR as well as the continuously changing situation in the mission area and other developments which may have an impact on the operational structure of UNPROFOR and its administrative and budgetary requirements, the Committee is of the view that the cost estimates for the 12-month period starting on 1 July 1993 are only indicative.
In this connection, the representatives of the Secretary-General stated that the current cost estimates would need to be revised following the finalization of the approved and possible other enlargements of UNPROFOR within the next months.
37. In view of the aforesaid, the Committee is of the view that an examination of the above cost estimates for the 12-month period starting on 1 July 1993 on the basis of the information available at present would be preliminary and based on assumptions which are subject to change.
In the circumstances, bearing in mind that the current mandate of UNPROFOR has been extended to 30 September 1993 and taking into account the potential for savings, as reflected in the performance report on UNPROFOR and the cost estimates until 30 June 1993, the Committee recommends that the General Assembly, at this stage, appropriate and assess $200 million gross for the maintenance of UNPROFOR at the current level for the period from 1 July to 30 September 1993.
38. The Committee believes that the above amount, in addition to the assessment of $86.4 million gross for the period from 1 April to 30 June 1993 (see para. 28 above) and an assessment of $55 million gross for the additional start-up requirements for the enlargements of the Force in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (see para. 35 above), should be adequate for the maintenance of UNPROFOR for the three-month period until the Secretary-General submits such additional requirements of UNPROFOR as may be necessary for the period starting 1 October 1993.
That report should include detailed information on the performance of UNPROFOR to that date and indicate the consolidated operational structure of the mission for all mandates in an integrated and coherent manner.
39. As regards the Secretary-General's proposal to apply the special arrangements as regards article IV of the Financial Regulations of the United Nations (A/47/741/Add.1, paras. 23 and 24) to UNPROFOR, the Committee concurs in his request on an exceptional basis, taking into account the particular circumstances of UNPROFOR and its financial status, on the understanding that the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolution 45/265 were intended for the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) and not for across-the-board application in all peace-keeping operations.
In this connection, the Committee recommends that the Secretary-General enhance his communication with troop-contributing States so that the Member States concerned submit the relevant information and claims under the Financial Regulations in a timely manner.
40. With regard to the Secretary-General's statement in paragraph 45 of his report concerning the need for continuing financial authorization for peace-keeping operations in the event that the requirements for extensions and/or enlargements exceed the provisions of General Assembly resolution 46/187 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses for the biennium 1992-1993, the Committee cautions against such a continuous practice.
In this connection, the Committee reiterates its view that the Secretary-General should streamline procedures to expedite the issuance of his reports on the financing of peace-keeping operations, thus enabling the General Assembly to take appropriate action in a timely manner.
Notes
1/ The higher net figure is due to a change in the basis for calculating staff assessment from a vacancy factor of 35 per cent to a vacancy factor of 40 per cent.

Forty-seventh session
Agenda item 120 (a)
FINANCING OF THE ACTIVITIES ARISING FROM SECURITY COUNCIL
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions
1. Paragraphs 1 to 30 of the Secretary-General's report (A/47/637/Add.1 and Corr.1) provide the standard information regarding, inter alia, the status of assessed contributions, voluntary contributions, the unencumbered balance, status of reimbursement to troop-contributing States, and a summary statement of the cost estimates for the periods 1 May to 31 October 1993 and 1 November 1993 to 31 October 1994, respectively.
The report also provides information on the strengthening of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM), which was authorized by the Security Council in its resolution 806 (1993) of 5 February 1993.
2. In paragraph 31, the Secretary-General enumerates the actions to be taken by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session, in connection with the financing of UNIKOM:
"(a) The appropriation of the amount of $19,800,000 gross ($18,600,000 net) authorized with the concurrence of the Advisory Committee under the terms of paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution 47/208 of 22 December 1992, for the maintenance of the Observation Mission for the period from 1 May to 31 October 1993;
"(b) The appropriation of the amount of $24,616,100 gross ($24,505,700 net) and the apportionment thereof for the enlargement of UNIKOM for the period from 1 May to 31 October 1993, inclusive of the $4 million authorized by the Advisory Committee;
"(c) With regard to the period after 31 October 1993, provision by means of appropriation and/or commitment authorization, as appropriate, of such amounts, should the Security Council decide to continue UNIKOM beyond that date; 93-42412 (E) 030893 /...
"(d) A decision to retain the unencumbered balance of appropriations in the Special Account for UNIKOM in the light of the outstanding assessed contributions;
"(e) A decision that the special arrangements as regards article IV of the Financial Regulations ... be applied to UNIKOM."
As discussed below, the Advisory Committee was informed that the amounts referred to in paragraph 31 (b) of the Secretary-General's report and cited above, have been adjusted downward by $42,200 gross ($36,100 net).
3. The Security Council, by its resolution 806 (1993), decided to extend the terms of reference of UNIKOM.
In this connection, the Committee recalls that in paragraph 5 of his report 1/ of 18 January 1993, the Secretary-General stated that should the Security Council decide "that UNIKOM's present mandate does not permit an adequate response to such violations as have occurred and that UNIKOM should be able to prevent and redress them, then UNIKOM would require a capacity to take physical action".
The Secretary-General went on to state that it was estimated that three mechanized infantry battalions (in place of the unarmed observers) would be required to perform the functions outlined in paragraph 5 of his report, together with the necessary increase in headquarters and support elements, as enumerated in paragraph 7 of his report.
4. In paragraph 12 of the same report, the Secretary-General noted that a force on the scale suggested would not have the capacity to prevent a significant military incursion and that if the Security Council considered that this risk existed, it would be necessary to make other arrangements for dealing with it.
5. By its resolution 806 (1993), the Security Council approved the report of the Secretary-General S/25123. and extended the terms of reference of UNIKOM to include the functions contained in paragraph 5 of that report.
The Council also requested the Secretary-General to plan and execute a phased deployment of the strengthening of UNIKOM, taking into account the need for economy and other relevant factors, and to report to the Council on any steps he intended to take following the initial deployment.
6. In his subsequent report of 2 April 1993, S/25514. the Secretary-General, recalling the above, stated that, after consulting with members of the Council, he planned "in the first phase to retain the military observers and to reinforce them by one mechanized infantry battalion to be deployed in the northern sector of the DMZ".
He also indicated that UNIKOM logistic support elements would be reinforced slightly (para. 10).
7. It is unclear to the Advisory Committee whether the decision to deploy one battalion at this time, in spite of the circumstances described in the report referred to in paragraph 3 above, was dictated by operational circumstances on the ground or by the need for economy.
Moreover, there is no indication of the conditions that would prompt the implementation of a second phase of deployment.
The Committee believes that information of this nature would, in future, be of assistance to Member States.
8. The strengthening of UNIKOM provides for the deployment of one mechanized infantry battalion comprising 775 troops, all ranks, 15 additional medical personnel, five additional logistic support personnel and seven military observers.
The Advisory Committee was informed that 50 additional civilian staff are required instead of the number of 51 indicated in the Secretary-General's report.
The decrease of one of the P-4 posts (Political Affairs Officer) requested results in a decrease of $42,200 gross ($36,100 net) in the estimates for the period 1 May to 31 October 1993 in view of reduced requirements relating to international staff salaries, common staff costs, mission subsistence allowance, travel, support account, staff assessment and the bottled water element of the rations calculation.
9. Accordingly, the estimated cost of strengthening UNIKOM for the period 1 May to 31 October 1993 is $24,573,900 gross ($24,469,600 net); the consolidated cost of maintaining UNIKOM for this six-month period is $44,373,900 gross ($43,069,600 net).
Annex IV to the Secretary-General's report provides a breakdown of the consolidated cost estimate for the period from 1 May to 31 October 1993; annex V provides supplementary information about the cost estimate for strengthening UNIKOM.
10. As stated in paragraph 5 of annex V, "it is not expected that the infantry battalion will be deployed before 1 August 1993.
Costs relating to the infantry and support personnel are therefore calculated for a period of three months, that is, from 1 August to 31 October 1993".
In response to inquiries concerning the deployment of the battalion, the Committee was informed that advanced negotiations were ongoing with a contributing country and that 1 August deployment remained a possibility.
However, subsequent to the Committee's meeting, the Committee was informed that the negotiations had not materialized and that other contributors were being sought.
In the circumstances, representatives of the Secretary-General stated that the arrival of the battalion could not be envisaged before mid-September 1993.
11. The cost estimate provides for 50 additional civilian staff comprising 19 international staff (2 Professional, 13 Field Service and 4 General Service) and 31 additional local staff.
As stated above, this total provides for one less P-4 post than indicated in paragraph 26 of annex V. The Advisory Committee notes from annex VIII that the staffing table currently provides for 186 posts, including 90 international staff; the proposed staffing table would amount to 236, including 109 international staff.
12. In response to inquiry, the Committee was informed that as at 31 May 1993, all international staff posts were filled.
As stated in paragraph 10 of annex V and as shown in annex IX, the costs of salaries, common staff costs, mission subsistence allowance and staff assessment for the 50 additional staff, which cover the period from 1 August to 31 October 1993, include a 15 percent vacancy factor.
In this connection, representatives of the Secretary-General informed the Committee that the mobilization of the additional civilian staff was dependent on the deployment of the battalion; that being the case, the above-mentioned vacancy factor had been included.
13. The Secretary-General's justification for the additional civilian staff requirements is contained in paragraphs 26 to 28 of annex V. In response to inquiry, the Committee was informed that once the Security Council decides on an increase in military strength, an assessment is made by the mission of the additional support civilian personnel it considers necessary.
This is in turn discussed with Headquarters units.
The Committee was also informed that the Chief Administrative Officer of a mission has the flexibility to deploy staff within functions as deemed necessary.
Thus for example, the distribution of the current complement of 23 Communications staff who are presently based at Umm Qasr, Doha, and Liaison Kuwait (see annex III) can be altered to meet the actual needs of the operation. English Page
14. It was difficult for the Advisory Committee to assess, on the basis of the information before it, whether there exists sufficient basis to approve all of the new posts being requested.
As noted above, it is the view of the Committee that requests of such nature should be justified in terms of existing resources, and indications given of, for example, why it was considered necessary to request 13 additional staff (4 Field Service and 9 local level) in the area of Transport as opposed to another number.
Noting the Secretary-General's statement that the workload of the Personnel Section will increase in view of the increase in the recruitment of local staff, the Committee queries the necessity, once such staff have been recruited, of retaining the additional posts in the Personnel Section.
As indicated in annex VIII, the Secretary-General's estimates for the period 1 November 1993 to 31 October 1994 provide for the full complement of staff now on board and being requested.
15. The Advisory Committee notes from the Secretary-General's report 2/ that UNIKOM's concept of operations is based on a combination of patrol/observation bases, observation points, ground and air patrols, investigation teams and liaison with the parties at all levels (para. 14).
The Committee further notes that the demilitarized zone (DMZ) is about 200 kilometres long, to which must be added the Khawr Abd Allah waterway, with a length of about 40 kilometres and that the boundaries of the DMZ, extend 10 kilometres into Iraq and 5 kilometres into Kuwait (paras. 11-12).
16. As stated in paragraph 13 of S/25514, at the end of February 1993, there were a total of 18 patrol/observation bases in the DMZ.
The estimates for strengthening UNIKOM provide for the construction and emplacement of eight checkpoints at entry/exit points leading into/out of the DMZ.
The estimates for the strengthened UNIKOM also provide for a total of four additional utility helicopters (one light and three medium) which will be used for air observation, logistic support, medical evacuation, command liaison and general utility purposes, and that they "must be available to provide platoon lift capability as a ready reaction force to border incidents" (annex V, para. 58).
17. In this connection, the Committee recalls that in annex VII, paragraph 42 of his report (A/47/637), the Secretary-General reported that six light utility helicopters would be required for the period from 1 November to 31 December 1992 and that for the period from 1 January to 31 October 1993, the number would be reduced to four, including one standby.
As also explained therein, the standby helicopter was a free back-up helicopter guaranteeing the 100 per cent availability of the other helicopters.
Charges for the standby helicopter would only take effect should there be a need for an additional helicopter.
Thus the strengthened mission will have seven helicopters plus one standby.
18. While not objecting to the estimate for additional helicopters, the Advisory Committee, taking into account the above-mentioned concept of operations, trusts that they will be procured in accordance with actual needs on the ground.
The Committee also hopes that in future representatives from the military side of the operation will be available to clarify questions the Committee may have in regard to the military requirements for which resources are being requested.
The Committee inquired about the unit cost of some of the equipment being proposed; as mentioned, the Committee intends to look into the whole question of procurement for peace-keeping operations.
20. The estimates for a strengthened UNIKOM provide $203,600 for a variety of miscellaneous equipment, as detailed in paragraph 83 of annex V. Included in that amount is provision for equipment deemed necessary to upgrade the laundry facilities, inherited from the Iraqi Government, in order to handle the increased volume of work that will result from an expansion of UNIKOM.
Related to this is the provision for contractual services in respect of laundry and dry cleaning as mentioned in paragraph 91 of annex V.
21. The Advisory Committee discussed these provisions with representatives of the Secretary-General.
The Committee was informed that it has been ascertained that it would be more cost-effective to upgrade the Umm Qasr facilities and to arrange for a contractual service to handle the dry cleaning and laundry requirements of the military personnel at this facility instead of having the laundry and dry cleaning done at commercial Kuwaiti rates.
22. The Committee is of the view that an improved presentation in respect of voluntary contributions is necessary and that the impact of such contributions on a fully costed budget is clearly evident.
As noted in the Secretary-General's report (A/47/637/Add.1/Corr.1), the Government of Kuwait has agreed in writing to provide 50 percent of the cost of petrol, oil and lubricants required by UNIKOM for operational needs.
A request for reimbursement for the period from 1 June 1991 had been submitted and, as at 15 July 1993, remained pending.
In response to inquiry, the Committee was informed that the petrol, oil and lubricant requirements of the operation are budgeted in full and that once actual reimbursement has been received for one half of the cost from the Kuwaiti Government, it would be recorded as income.
In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, once a written pledge has been received from a Government, it should be reflected accordingly as an offset to the fully costed budget with a consequential impact on the amount to be appropriated and assessed.
23. As stated in paragraph 2 above, the Secretary-General, in view of the outstanding contributions, proposed to retain the unencumbered balance of appropriations in the special account of UNIKOM.
He also proposes to extend the special arrangements with respect to article IV of the Financial Regulations of the United Nations, as contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 45/265 of 17 May 1991, to UNIKOM.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this request.
24. The Secretary-General also requests provision by means of appropriation and/or commitment authorization, as appropriate, of such amounts, should the Security Council decide to continue UNIKOM beyond 31 October 1993.
In this connection, the Secretary-General estimates the recurring costs of continuing UNIKOM for the period from 1 November 1993 to 31 October 1994 at $74,852,400 gross ($72,642,900 net). (These figures take into consideration the reduction resulting from the reduced civilian staff requirements (see para. 11 above).)
25. The Committee was informed by representatives of the Secretary-General that the estimate had been prepared on a 12-month basis in order to arrive at a realistic average monthly cost; that is, it was not the Secretary-General's intention that authorization be given for the 12-month period beyond 31 October 1993.
Rather, the idea was an attempt to rationalize the submission of reports on peace-keeping operations to the General Assembly.
26. As a consequence, the review of an operation would take place on a yearly basis, on the basis of which an appropriation would be approved for the existing mandate/period of continuation, which in the case of UNIKOM, would be for the period 1 May to 31 October 1993.
Commitment authority would be made for the subsequent six-month period, that is, from 1 November to 30 April 1994, but no assessment would take place in respect of mandate periods not yet approved by the Security Council, or, in the case of UNIKOM, prior to a decision by the Council on its continuation beyond a given date.
In the spring of 1994, a performance report would be submitted to a resumed session of the Assembly.
27. Representatives of the Secretary-General acknowledged that the Assembly will be in session when the current period of UNIKOM expires.
However, in view of the six-week lead time necessary to prepare a report and the strained capacity of the Secretariat, the annualization of the submission, not unlike that which occurs in the case of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), has been proposed.
Representatives of the Secretary-General also emphasized that should the Security Council decide on changes to the operation which would impact significantly on the estimates, the Committee would be so informed.
28. The Committee discussed this proposal with representatives of the Secretary-General.
While not opposed in principle, the Committee is of the view that the matter should be addressed in a more comprehensive manner which would, inter alia, set forth a projected timetable of submissions in respect of all operations.
Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Secretary-General resubmit this proposal in the context of the report on peace-keeping operations requested in its report on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of peace-keeping operations (A/47/990, paras. 37 and 39).
29. The Advisory Committee recommends the appropriation of the amount of $19,800,000 gross ($18,600,000 net) authorized with the concurrence of the Advisory Committee under the terms of paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution 47/208 of 22 December 1992, for the maintenance of the Observation Mission for the period from 1 May to 31 October 1993.
In light of its observations in the preceding paragraphs, and in view of the uncertainty with regard to the deployment of the mechanized battalion, the Advisory Committee also recommends that the additional appropriation and apportionment for the enlargement of UNIKOM for the period from 1 May to 31 October 1993 should not exceed $20 million gross.
The total appropriation and apportionment for the period from 1 May to 31 October 1993 should therefore not exceed $39.8 million gross.
Should the Security Council decide to continue UNIKOM beyond October 1993, the Committee, pending its consideration of the above-mentioned report of the Secretary-General, recommends that the Secretary-General submit a brief report to the Assembly outlining the projected requirements for such period and requesting the necessary appropriation.

THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST
Letter dated 26 July 1993 from the Permanent Representative
of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the
Secretary-General
On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to inform you of the facts relating to the extensive Israeli attacks on Lebanon and its citizens on 25 and 26 July 1993.
- At 1030 hours on the morning of Sunday, 25 July 1993, six Israeli warplanes bombed the city of Baalbeck and the villages of Janta and Ain al-Tinah.
- At 1040 hours, Israeli helicopters carried out a raid on the town of Siddiqin to the east of Tyre and also on the area to the west of Markaba in the western Bekaa.
- At the same time, Israeli warplanes bombed the Naamah hills to the south of Beirut.
- At 1110 hours, Israeli warplanes carried out a raid on the town of Mashgharah and also on the town of Yohmor in the western Bekaa.
- At 1150 hours, Israeli warplanes carried out a raid on the town of Mlita in Iqlim al-Tuffah.
- At the same time, Israeli aircraft fired missiles and dropped time bombs to the south of the Litani dam, causing large numbers of the inhabitants to flee the area.
Page
- At 1700 hours, Israeli helicopters carried out a raid on the town of Zawtar al-Gharbiyah.
- At 1555 hours, Israeli helicopters bombed the Naamah hills to the south of Beirut; this was followed by Israeli air force raids on the same region.
- At 1630 hours, Israeli aircraft carried out a raid on the town of Zibqin within the region where UNIFIL international forces are deployed.
- At 1640 hours, Israeli helicopters attacked the area surrounding Zawtar al-Sharqiyah and Zawtar al-Gharbiyah.
At 1715 hours, they carried out a raid on Nabatiyah al-Fauqa.
- At 1810 hours, Israeli aircraft carried out a raid on the Bass refugee camp to the east of Tyre and the Ain al-Hilwa camp to the east of Sidon.
- At 1825 hours, Israeli helicopters carried out a raid on the towns of Qillaya and Zillaya in the western Bekaa.
- Between 1600 hours and 1715 hours, Israeli helicopters fired 13 missiles at the town of Mashgharah, 8 missiles at the town of Majdel Silm, 3 missiles at the town of Haddatha, 2 missiles at the town of Haris and 2 missiles at the towns of Kafra and Zawtar.
- At 1850 hours, two Israeli helicopters again attacked the Naamah hills.
- At 1903 hours, two Israeli helicopters carried out a raid on the town of Sohmor in the western Bekaa and Markaba valley.
- During the night of 25/26 July 1993, the Israeli raids continued, taking in the towns of Abra to the east of Sidon, Jibshit and Maydun.
The towns and villages of Nabatiyah, Siddiqin, Kafra, Jibal al-Batm, Braashit, Tibnin, Yatar, Mashghara and Ain al-Tinah were all subjected to heavy artillery shelling.
- At 2400 hours, Israeli gunboats shelled the Beddawi and al-Barid refugee camps to the north of Tripoli.
- At the same time, Israeli warplanes fired air-to-ground missiles at the Naamah hills.
- At 0015 hours on the morning of 26 July 1993, an Israeli helicopter fired an air-to-ground missile at the town of Ain al-Tinah in the western Bekaa.
- At 1045 hours, the Israeli navy again shelled the Beddawi camp to the north of Tripoli.
- On the same morning, Israeli aircraft also carried out raids in the region surrounding Natatiyah, Iqlim al-Tuffah and Maifadun.
At 0655 hours, the town of Habbush was subjected to shelling by 155-mm artillery.
- At 0715 hours, Israeli aircraft bombed Dayr al-Zahrani and the town of al-Sharqiyah-al-Nabatiyah.
- At 0730 hours, Israeli aircraft bombed Jabal al-Ahmar, the town of Faqra and the Naamah hills.
At the same time, an Israeli warship heading northwards was sighted from the shore at Zahrani.
These attacks claimed the lives of over 30 people, mostly civilian women and children, left hundreds wounded and caused extensive damage to property and buildings.
During the last two days, the Israeli occupation authorities issued repeated warnings to the population; these warnings, together with the heavy bombardment, led to the flight of thousands of families from the south to safe areas in the north.
This dangerous escalation comes after a military build-up by Israel over the past few weeks.
It constitutes a serious threat to peace in the region and directly jeopardizes the current peace negotiations.
The tragedies occurring in Lebanon are the result of continued Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa, which is a brazen infringement of Lebanese sovereignty and territorial integrity and a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law.
The Lebanese Government again condemns and denounces the aggressive and dangerous escalation of attacks against Lebanon and the security of its citizens and urges the international community, represented by the Security Council, in particular its five permanent members, to take the necessary measures to halt the Israeli aggression by implementing forthwith Security Council resolution 425 (1978), which calls for the withdrawal of Israel from Lebanese territory and the ending of the abnormal situation in southern Lebanon.
I should be grateful if you would have this letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly and of the Security Council.

ANNEX
Letter dated 26 July 1993 from Mr. Osman Ertuǧ
I have the honour to draw your attention to the negative implications for the process of negotiations on the Cyprus issue, conducted under your auspices, of the report (Avis) issued by the Commission of the European Communities on 30 June 1993, concerning the unilateral application of the Greek Cypriot side for European Community (EC) membership.
I should first of all like to re-emphasize that, as it had also been explained to all concerned at the time, the unilateral Greek Cypriot application for Community membership is devoid of any legal basis, as it was made without any consultation with, and the assent of, the Turkish Cypriot side.
It is neither compatible with the 1960 Agreements establishing the "Republic of Cyprus", according to which the basis of legitimacy was the political partnership and joint decision-making of the two national communities of equal political status; nor with the present realities prevailing on the island, namely, the existence of two separate, independent States, neither of which has the right or competence to act or take decisions on behalf of the other or the island as a whole.
Your Excellency will no doubt recall the tremendous difficulties that the Greek Cypriot application had created for the negotiations when it was submitted in July 1990.
At a time when the process aimed at a mutually acceptable solution based on the free will and political equality of the two peoples was continuing, the efforts of one party to determine unilaterally the future of the island on as important a matter as EC membership was, and continues to be, totally contrary to the spirit and purpose of the negotiations.
It was in cognizance of this fact that the Secretary-General, through his spokesman, had stated, on 11 September 1993, that the question of EC membership for Cyprus constitutes one of the issues that should be negotiated and agreed upon between the two sides within the framework of an overall settlement.
In spite of such a manifestation of lack of political will on the part of the Greek Cypriot side for a negotiated solution, the Turkish Cypriot side has since continued the talks, in the hope and expectation that the EC Commission would refrain from taking action on the application in the interest of the negotiating process.
However, the report of the EC Commission, which states, inter alia, that "the Commission is willing to begin immediately talks with the Government of Cyprus", indicates that these hopes and expectations have been in vain.
In the light of the above and in awareness of the new obstacles that this development creates for the process of negotiations, I am confident that you will use your influence with all concerned so that the Greek Cypriot application for EC membership is not carried any further, deepening the existing lack of trust between the two sides and rendering your efforts more difficult.

ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUDGETARY ASPECTS OF THE FINANCING OF THE
UNITED NATIONS PEACE-KEEPING OPERATIONS
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions
1. At its special summer session of 1993, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) (A/47/733/Add.1), the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) (A/47/751/Add.1), the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) (A/47/916/Add.1), the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) (A/47/969), the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) (A/47/741/Add.1 and Corr.1) and the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) (A/47/637/Add.1 and Corr.1).
The Committee's observations and recommendations thereon are being issued in documents A/47/982-987.*
2. The consideration by the Advisory Committee of the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of those and other missions has elicited a number of general observations and recommendations which pertain to most, if not all, peace-keeping operations and are set out below.
3. The reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of peace-keeping operations contain information on financial performance, and budget projections.
However, the Committee believes that the presentation needs to be improved and that the time has come for a different type of report which would provide more evaluation and analysis in terms of the major items of expenditure.
For example, it serves little purpose for the performance report to include a statement to the effect that savings for one sub-item were partially offset by increased expenditure under another sub-item if the changes are not substantiated and justified.
* See annex for a list of Committee reports cited in the present report.
93-42909 (E) 050893 /...
4. In this connection, the Committee states once again that the performance reports on peace-keeping operations should contain the proposed and actual staffing table, indicating the number of troops, military observers, police monitors, international civilian and local personnel and international contractual personnel at all levels, including the related vacancy rates, the proposed deployment schedule compared to the actual dates of arrival of staff in the mission area and delays in troop-months or work-days and the related savings or overexpenditures (see A/47/763, para. 24).
The Committee further notes that temporary staff are part of the establishment of a peace-keeping operation and should be listed in the staffing table on a monthly basis (see A/46/773, para. 14).
5. The Committee points out that any deployment of military and police personnel in the mission area of an operation over and above the strength and mandate period authorized by the Security Council should be reported to the Council prior to inclusion in the related cost estimates (see A/46/904, para. 13).
6. The Committee further points out that the proposed establishment of new posts, in particular at the senior level, should be well justified in the Secretary-General's reports on the financing of peace-keeping operations, containing a description of the functional responsibilities of new posts in the context of the overall structure of the mission.
In this connection, the Committee is of the view that there is a need for a clear statement of the rationale for the establishment of posts at the Assistant Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General levels.
7. Along the same lines, requests for additional requirements such as salaries, allowances, travel, transportation, air operations, communication, equipment and services should be clearly presented and justified in terms of resources, taking into account previous performance, developments on the ground and new mandates.
For example, changes in air operations should be specified in the performance report and in the cost estimates for proposed extensions, indicating the planned and actual scope of operations in the mission area, number and type of aircraft, date of actual deployment, flying hours, hire/charter costs, ground handling and allowances for air crew.
In this connection, the Committee reiterates its recommendation that the Secretary-General's reports on the financing of peace-keeping operations should contain detailed organigrams of the structure of the operation with the main functions of the personnel, specification of all units and identification of their location on a map in the mission area, a breakdown of premises per unit with an indication of capacity, the allocation of vehicles in the various units and areas, narratives and charts on the functioning of communications systems, distribution of communications, office and other equipment, calculation of travel costs and a list of contingent-owned equipment (see A/46/893, para. 29).
8. The Committee discussed these issues with the representatives of the Secretary-General.
The Committee points to the need to limit the volume of documentation; it is of the view that a revamped and concise format for such reports with less narrative text and more tables and graphics, substantiating the financial performance and estimates, would be of more value, not only to the Advisory Committee but also to all Member States (see also para. 3 above).
9. The reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of peace-keeping operations should also include an improved presentation of voluntary contributions, so that, in particular, the value of a voluntary contribution in respect of an item which has been budgeted for can be clearly set off against the total budget, the balance of which is appropriated.
Moreover, in keeping with the Committee's previous recommendations, all requirements should be fully costed on the same basis whether they are to be supplied through voluntary contributions or the budgetary process.
A clear differentiation between what is a voluntary contribution and what constitutes part of a host country's obligation is also necessary, as defined by the relevant status-of-forces agreement.
10. In this connection, the Committee points out that there is a need to define clearly the role of assessed budgets for humanitarian and development activities.
The Committee is of the view that the Secretary-General's reports should specify the activities such as mine-clearing, establishment of assembly areas and repair or construction of roads which relate directly to an operation and which should be financed through assessment; however, any activities with regard to the long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction of a country would be financed from other sources (see A/47/763, paras. 34 and 52).
The Committee therefore requests that the Secretary-General provide a clearer definition of the short-term humanitarian requirements of a mission and the long-term needs with a view to achieving greater consistency in the proposed financing of those activities.
In addition, the Committee believes that information on trust funds set up for financing humanitarian activities relevant to the budget of a peace-keeping operation should also be provided.
11. In recent years the Committee has made a number of general observations and recommendations with a view to enhancing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of peace-keeping operations and reducing the substantial costs of the increasing number of large operations.
The Committee is of the view that there is a need for follow-up and appropriate action.
In this connection, the Committee recalls its recommendation (A/45/801, para. 33) that in the case of operations with a large civilian component, it would be useful for the Secretary-General to request Member States to provide additional qualified civilian personnel to carry out non-core functions in view of the overall programmatic and budgetary considerations, thus reducing the costs of large peace-keeping operations and containing the use of the limited resources of the Secretariat.
The Committee urges the Secretary-General to implement this recommendation for technical and non-technical personnel in case of particularly large operations (see A/46/893, para. 17; A/46/904, para. 18; A/46/945, para. 21).
The Committee has pointed out that nothing should prevent the Secretary-General from approaching Member States on a preliminary basis in anticipation of launching an operation and prior to budget approval (see A/46/916, para. 25).
12. In view of the Secretary-General's continued difficulties in obtaining suitable civilian police monitors for peace-keeping operations and the resulting long delays in their deployment which undermine the success of the missions, the Committee is of the view that appropriate measures need to be taken to initiate their selection and appropriate training at an earlier date and to expedite their full deployment as scheduled.
13. The Committee has noted that in several instances the Secretary-General has used New York standards for the calculation of staff costs and related requirements.
This practice should be reviewed by the Secretary-General so as to ensure that the lowest standard costs appropriate to the operational area will be used.
14. The Committee understands that a considerable number of staff in peace-keeping operations are detailed from posts financed from the regular budget.
The Committee points out that, to the extent that these individuals are not replaced, there will be potential cost savings under the regular budget.
15. The Committee is of the view that, pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 44/192 of 21 December 1989 and 45/258 of 3 May 1991, the Secretary-General should establish standard procedures governing the provision of civilian personnel by Member States for peace-keeping operations, including volunteers.
To this end, the Committee reiterates its recommendation that the Secretary-General should develop specific guidelines for participation by the civilian personnel provided by Governments along the lines of those guidelines which are issued for election and police monitors (see A/46/916, para. 24).
The Committee also notes the significant number of international General Service staff employed in peace-keeping operations.
It believes that greater efforts should be made to recruit such personnel locally.
16. The Committee stresses the need for adequate training of administrative personnel serving in peace-keeping operations, especially in the areas of financial control, procurement and personnel administration.
Moreover, the Committee believes that the existing financial controls in peace-keeping operations should be fully exercised at the earliest possible time after the commencement of a mission.
In this connection, there is a need to strengthen the functions of internal audit, evaluation, investigation and management advisory service in missions to ensure compliance with the existing statutory provisions and the accountability of administrative personnel.
17. With regard to the provision of consultants and experts for technical and other assistance, the Committee believes it is possible that a major part of these functions could be performed by the civilian establishment of large operations to achieve maximum economy in this area (see A/46/904, para. 17).
18. As regards international contractual personnel, the Committee is of the view that certain aspects of this approach need to be brought to the attention of the General Assembly, including whether their rates of pay should reflect primarily their country of recruitment or the quality of the service delivered, due regard being paid to compliance with the principle of equal pay for equal work and safeguards against the possibility of abuse and the exploitation of vulnerable groups by contractors.
19. Considering the positive experience with volunteers in election monitoring as a cost-effective and efficient contribution to peace-keeping, the Committee reiterates its recommendation that the use of volunteers in peace-keeping operations should be expanded.
In addition, their terms and conditions of service should incorporate appropriate cover for death and disability.
20. The Committee has observed in a number of operations that the mission subsistence allowance provided to all international civilian personnel, military observers and civilian police monitors is substantially higher than the daily subsistence allowance rates established by the International Civil Service Commission.
The Committee believes that there are anomalies in the determination and application of those rates and therefore requests a review of the methodology for the determination of the rates and their application (see A/46/893, para. 11; A/46/945, para. 14; A/47/900, para. 15).
21. In this connection, the Committee observed that in a large number of operations the mission subsistence allowance increased rapidly, owing to large rent increases in the mission area, which are often inflated and result in substantial additional costs.
The Committee recommends that the Secretary-General explore questions related to the economic impact of a peace-keeping operation on a particular area of operation with a view to minimizing the disruptive effect on both the United Nations and the local economy.
22. The Committee was of the view that in a number of operations the estimated costs for air travel of military and civilian personnel to and from the mission area are high and that account should consistently be taken of the potential for savings through group travel and other economy measures.
In this connection, the Committee reiterates its view that travel of all military contingents to and from the mission area by air charter may not always be required, except in the case of early emplacement, and travel by surface transport for rotation and repatriation of troops to nearby countries should be considered, where practical and more economical (see A/46/893, para. 13).
23. The Committee recalls that in a number of operations the host country does not provide premises for the mission and accommodation for the staff without cost to the mission or, where applicable, water, electricity and other facilities free of charge or at the most favourable rates pursuant to its obligations under the model status-of-forces agreement (A/45/594, annex).
The Committee has made numerous recommendations on this matter (see A/45/1021, para. 14; A/46/893, paras. 19-22; A/46/904, para. 20; A/46/945, paras. 13 and 25; A/47/900, para. 21), but often the Secretary-General has indicated in his reports that his continued efforts with the host country have not been successful and the mission is required to rent premises and accommodation for staff at high market rates.
The Secretary-General should endeavour to settle these problems in the context of his negotiations with host countries on the status-of-forces agreement.
24. At the same time, the Committee points out that the budgets of some operations were in fact inflated by the inclusion of substantial provision for prefabricated units for accommodation which were not required.
The Committee believes that prefabricated units for accommodation of staff should be provided only if there is a definite need established by means of an initial survey in the mission area, and taking into account the availability of housing and the potential for construction (see A/47/763, paras. 21 and 28).
25. The Committee is concerned at the high costs relating to periodic (six-month) rotation of civilian and military components, particularly in very large operations which are well established.
The Committee therefore reiterates its recommendation that the Secretary-General review all entitlements, allowances and duration of duty of military and civilian personnel serving in peace-keeping operations and report on the results to the General Assembly in accordance with resolution 45/258, with a view to containing the substantial costs of large operations (see A/46/893, para. 13; A/46/945, para. 23; A/47/763, para. 44).

26. The Committee believes that there is a need to address the Organization's role in the provision of services to the troops, which include miscellaneous services and contractual services (laundering, tailoring, haircutting, shoe repair, security services, garbage removal and other services), at the expense of the Organization.
In the Committee's opinion, the time has come for the Organization to review its role concerning such services.
The Committee also notes the differentiated treatment of death and disability benefits based on national practice and recommends a more detailed consideration of this practice.
The Committee also recommends that the Secretary-General indicate clearly the compensation for death, injury, disability or illness resulting from service with peace-keeping operations.
The rationale underlying the provision of such reimbursement to Governments should also be clearly explained.
27. As regards pension benefits, the Committee recalls that under the current Regulations and Rules of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, any full-time staff member who completes six months of service without an interruption of more than 30 days becomes a participant in the Fund "provided that participation is not expressly excluded by the terms of his appointment" (art. 21).
The Committee questions the application of a system designed for long-term staff members to locally recruited staff of short-term peace-keeping operations and recalls that it will cause an avoidable increase in the costs of an operation, without benefiting the staff, and impose an enormous administrative burden on the Fund.
The Committee therefore requests the Secretary-General to comment on any issues raised by its recommendation in the context of UNTAC that such staff should be excluded from participation in the Fund (see A/46/916, para. 33).
28. The Committee recalls that there are considerable delays in the submission of information from Governments concerning the inventory and value of contingent-owned equipment, resulting in late reimbursement to troop contributors.
In this connection, the Committee was informed that the United Nations does not have the capability to value such equipment and needs to obtain the expertise from Governments.
In view of the foregoing, the Committee believes that there is a need to simplify the current procedures to expedite such reimbursement.
The Committee further recalls that the schedule of reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment was established in March 1978 and needs to be reviewed (see A/46/893, para. 15).
The Committee recommends that the matter be addressed in the report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.
29. With regard to equipment which is being transferred from one operation to another, the Committee reiterates its view that it is not appropriate for Member States to be assessed twice for the same equipment even though the charge would be at depreciated rates and subsequently be shown as a credit to the operation for which it was originally budgeted.
The Committee therefore recommends that equipment which has already been charged to one operation should be budgeted but not assessed for the operation to which it is being transferred (see A/46/904, paras. 8 and 9; A/46/945, para. 27).
30. During the course of its reviews, the Committee raised a number of concerns with regard to procurement for peace-keeping operations.
The Committee is of the view that the current procedures need to be examined and urgent measures taken to enhance cost-effectiveness and efficiency through better control, streamlining of the process and long-term planning.
In the opinion of the Committee, this is an area which merits further study, particularly in the light of the observations of the Board of Auditors concerning the lack of adherence to certain regulations in respect of procurement.
31. In this connection, the Committee recalls the need to ensure the acquisition of equipment that is compatible with the need of the mission; the proposed procurement of communications, office and miscellaneous equipment should not have a more sophisticated standard than is required for the operation, taking into account the local environment (see A/45/1005, para. 18; A/46/893, para. 26; A/46/904, para. 24; A/46/945, para. 31).
The Committee requests that the procedures for determining specifications of equipment be reviewed so that only equipment is purchased that would adequately meet the requirements to carry out the functions of the mission (see A/46/916, para. 62).
Furthermore, any equipment available from other operations or from the supply depot should be utilized (see A/45/1011, para. 18).
32. The Committee has noted in a number of missions that the cost for air operations appeared to be high, taking into account the mandate of the missions, the size and infrastructure of the mission area, the vehicle establishment and the size of the military and civilian personnel.
The Committee was also of the view that the hire charges for aircraft, fuel and related services were too high and that there was a potential for substantial savings (see A/46/904, para. 23; A/46/945, para. 29; A/47/763, para. 54).
The Committee therefore reiterates its recommendation that air operations should be planned cost-effectively on the best prevailing market rates for suitable aircraft and services, based on the actual needs of the mission pursuant to the mandate.
The Committee believes that the use of aircraft could be rationalized, including longer-term leases for the air fleet which would result in economies.
Furthermore, the Force Commander of each mission should keep air operations under review with a view to making economies.
33. The Committee states again that the allocation of vehicles should be planned cost-effectively according to the actual needs of an operation with a view to making economies.
Vehicles should not be assigned for the exclusive use of a staff member unless there are exceptional circumstances; moreover, group travel arrangements for civilian staff should be made whenever possible (see A/46/904, para. 22).
The Committee believes that a breakdown of the planned allocation of vehicles in each unit compared to the number of staff assigned in the various areas of the mission would be useful.
34. The Committee notes that the cost of third-party vehicle insurance in peace-keeping operations is high and needs to be re-examined in view of the considerably lower world-wide standard cost of such insurance.
The Committee therefore reiterates its suggestion that the Organization should explore the possibility of starting its own self-insurance or seeking less expensive insurance facilities (see A/46/916, para. 58).
35. The Committee reiterates its view that public information activities for the promotion of peace-keeping operations outside the area of operation, which have not been specifically mandated by the Security Council, should be financed from the existing resources for public information of the regular programme budget of the United Nations (see A/45/1043, para. 15; A/46/904, paras. 25 and 26; A/46/916, para. 71; A/46/945, para. 32).
The Committee recalls that the original programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993 provides, under section 31, $100.9 million for public information.
36. The Committee further observed that provision for funding of posts from the support account for peace-keeping operations on the basis of 8.5 per cent of the total cost of salaries, common staff costs and travel of the civilian staff in the mission area may not be fully required in operations with a large civilian establishment (see A/46/893, para. 28; A/46/916, para. 77).
The Committee intends to review this ratio as well as the validity of an approach based on a ratio in the context of its consideration of the Secretary-General's proposals on the support account in his report to the General Assembly.
37. The Committee also discussed with the Secretariat the possibility of preparing a manual which would provide the standards underlying the costing of all peace-keeping operations and explain the process whereby an operation, once approved by the Security Council, is translated into human and other requirements.
The manual would also explain the different types of equipment which are generic to most operations.
In making this recommendation, the Committee recalls that in his report on the requirements for United Nations peace-keeping operations (A/45/217), the Secretary-General discussed those requirements in general, in terms of military personnel and the material and technical resources and services required for such personnel.
The Committee emphasizes that the manual which it envisages should not duplicate that report but rather provide more technical details.
38. While the Committee acknowledges the need for some flexibility in the administration of peace-keeping operations to cover unforeseen requirements, the Committee believes that in view of the frequent and large savings or overexpenditures and transfers of funds between different items, as reflected in the performance reports, there is a need for greater budgetary discipline and control in carrying out such missions.
The Committee recommends that the internal audit function in peace-keeping operations should be substantially strengthened both in the mission area and at Headquarters.
The timely submission of reports to the Advisory Committee and the General Assembly and the procedure for requesting commitment authority also need to be addressed.
39. The Committee believes that there is also a lack of general guidelines, principles and procedures governing the disposition of assets after a peace-keeping operation has been liquidated.
The Committee therefore requests the Secretary-General to prepare proposals for consideration by the General Assembly, which should take into account the liquidation experience in recent peace-keeping operations which have been terminated, such as the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group.
40. In view of what has been stated in the preceding paragraphs, and the lack of a clear response thus far on a number of the Committee's observations and recommendations that have been reiterated above, the Committee recommends that the Secretary-General submit a comprehensive report to the General Assembly on all issues which affect the successful operation and administration of peace-keeping operations, including what action he has taken on the Committee's observations and recommendations, and proposals to enhance the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of peace-keeping operations.
In this connection, the Committee recalls that, in section III of its resolution 47/218 of 23 December 1992, the General Assembly reiterated its request, contained in its resolution 45/258, that the Secretary-General submit a report on a review of the present practices and approaches regarding the calculation of expenditures incurred by the United Nations in the conduct of peace-keeping operations, including the financial arrangements of the Organization with Governments in this respect.
In the opinion of the Committee, that report could be incorporated into the above-mentioned comprehensive report.
41. The Committee also recommends that the Secretary-General submit his recommendations regarding the non-payment or late payment of contributions to peace-keeping operations.
Although the General Assembly, in section III of its resolution 47/218, reiterated its call upon all Member States to pay their assessed contributions in full and on time, as at 31 May 1993, a total of $1,283,125,797 remained uncollected in respect of the peace-keeping operations listed in document ST/ADM/SER.B/411; this demonstrates the seriousness of the situation which, in the Committee's opinion, jeopardizes the viability of such operations.
42. The Committee has noted in the recent reports of the Secretary-General a general tendency to propose the establishment of a "special financial period" of 12 months to assist with the orderly administration of the financing of peace-keeping operations.
This approach may be particularly suited to operations which have a stable pattern.
Such an approach would not conflict with the separate arrangements for defining the mandate period and would not lead to annual assessments since Member States can only be assessed for the period of an existing mandate.
The Committee is of the view that 12-month financial periods and standardization of performance periods could simplify the task of the budgetary organs by providing for a full annual review of the financial performance and cost projections for a period realistic in financial management terms.
Subsequent assessments could then be based on a simpler form of report containing only relevant variations from the major report.
The Committee requests the Secretary-General to consider all the implications of this approach and the modalities for its application to consideration of peace-keeping operations by the Advisory Committee and the General Assembly, with a view to making recommendations on this matter as soon as possible.

RESTRUCTURING AND REVITALIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN THE
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND RELATED FIELDS
Letter dated 28 July 1993 from the President of the Economic and
Social Council to the President of the General Assembly
I am writing to you on behalf of the Bureau of the Economic and Social Council, in connection with the decision to postpone action under agenda item 47, entitled "Restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields", taken by the General Assembly at its 107th plenary meeting, held on 25 June 1993.
The membership of the Economic and Social Council has been following with the keenest interest the deliberations of the working group created by the General Assembly for this matter, so it was with disappointment that we learned of the aforementioned outcome.
It is essential that the necessary measures for the restructuring and revitalization of the Economic and Social Council be adopted expeditiously in order to enhance further the capacity of the Council to undertake the responsibilities envisaged for it in the Charter of the United Nations.
This view was constantly and widely expressed during the current session of the Council by delegations of all regional groups, and United Nations officials throughout the high-level, coordination and operational segments.
Therefore, the Bureau wishes to convey to you that there is a widespread feeling shared among the member States of the Economic and Social Council on the urgent need to come to an agreement on this matter before the closure of the current session of the General Assembly.
It would be very positive if a decision on the matter is taken before the next General Assembly in order to expedite the necessary further action in the process of revitalization and restructuring, including the important question of the rationalization of the agendas of the Council and the relevant bodies of the General Assembly in the economic and social fields.
The members of the Bureau remain at your disposal to assist you at your convenience in your endeavours on this matter.
I should be grateful if you would have this letter circulated as an official document of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly under agenda item 47.

THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST
Letter dated 28 July 1993 from the Permanent Representative
of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the
Secretary-General
Further to my letter of 26 July 1993 (A/47/988-S/26165) concerning the facts of the extensive Israeli assault on Lebanese territory, I regret to inform you that Israel still persists today, for the fourth day in succession, in conducting air raids on Lebanese towns and villages, and the artillery of its occupying army continues to shell the villages of southern Lebanon with 175-mm and 155-mm field artillery and tank guns.
This is being done with a view to causing maximum damage to people and property, in implementation of its declared plans to empty the south of its inhabitants, which thus far has led to the exodus of some 300,000 people towards the capital, Beirut, and confront the Lebanese Government with a dangerous social and political situation that will jeopardize its recent achievements in reunifying the country, extending order and the rule of law throughout its territory and pursuing a policy of national economic revival and growth after the well-known bloody and destructive events of the past.
The Israeli forces have issued fresh warnings to the population of Sidon and Tyre to evacuate the cities because they will subsequently be subjected to Israeli bombardment.
This new Israeli aggression and its tragic and catastrophic consequences confirm Israel's resolute policy of undermining the stability of Lebanon, weakening its central authority, impeding its return to normalcy and frustrating its citizens' aspirations for a decent life in a prosperous country.
The Israeli occupation, which has continued for 15 years, has not served the purpose of providing security for northern Israel. On the Lebanese side, it has claimed scores of lives, left hundreds wounded and inflicted continuous damage on property and vital utilities.
Peace will not come to Lebanon and the region as long as Israel continues to occupy southern Lebanon.
The latest military escalation threatens to exacerbate the cycle of violence and crushes all hope of bringing about the peace to which the peoples of the region aspire.
The following are the facts of the Israeli attacks over the past two days:
- At 1100 hours on the morning of Monday, 26 July 1993, Israeli fighter aircraft and helicopters carried out raids on Ain al-Hilwa camp east of Sidon.
- At 1215 hours, Israeli aircraft carried out a raid on Mashgara, Sohmor and Ain Tineh in the western Bekaa, destroying a number of private houses.
- At the same time, Israeli fighter aircraft conducted a raid on Wadi al-Sheikh in the western Bekaa, destroying two homes.
- At 1315 hours, fighter aircraft conducted a raid on the villages of Qana, Hannowieh, Kafra, Ramadieh and Siddiquin.
- At 1400 hours, Hmeiri was raided and at 1450 hours the raids targeted Qana, Aitit and Maaroub east of Tyre.
- At 1500 hours, a helicopter raid was conducted on Mahrouneh and Joaya east of Tyre and two Israeli helicopters strafed the wooded slopes of Jabal al-Rayhan with machine-gun fire.
- At 1700 hours, fighter aircraft conducted raids on the railway station near Ain al-Hilwa camp in Sidon, on Mayasseh farm in Iqlim al-Tuffah and on Salihiye east of Sidon.
Raids were also carried out on Tibnin, Haris, Ain Bossoir, Jabaa, Zawtar al-Sharqiye and Zawtar al-Gharbiye.
- At 1730 hours, Israeli aircraft carried out raids on Nabatiye, Kfar Roumman, Zawtar, Kafr Tibnit, Haris, Aitit, Khirbat Silm, Kafra, Yatar, Jmeijmeh, Dayr Amis, Sultaniye, Siddiquin, Zahrani and Bossoir.
These air raids killed and wounded a number of civilians and caused extensive damage to the villages and to property.
They were accompanied throughout the day and night by heavy Israeli shelling with 175-mm and 155-mm field artillery of Arabsalim, Jarjou, Jebaa, Ain Bossoir, Houmin al-Fawqa, Houmin al-Tahta, Kfarmelki, Mlita, Loueize, Jabal Safi and the villages of Iqlim al-Tuffah.
In the western Bekaa, the shelling was directed at the villages of Mashgara, Maidoun, Ain Tineh, Sohmor, Yohmor and Zallaya.
East of Tyre, it was directed against the villages of Aitit, Qana, Hannowieh, Dayr Amis, Hinniye, Qarih, Knayse, Siddiquin and Zibqin.
In the afternoon, the shelling was directed against the villages of Mansouriye, Qalile, Maaroub, Braachit, Shaqra, Khirbat Silm, Majdal Silm, Kafra, Yatar, Qabrikha, Haddatha, Ayta al-Jabal, Sawwan, Barish, Safad al-Battikh, Touline, Tamriye and Souane.
In the central sector, the city of Nabatiye and its environs were subjected to heavy shelling throughout the day.
The villages of Tibnin, Kfar Tibnit, Zawtar, Maifadoun, Zifta, Aba, Doueir, Froun, Ghandouriye and Shoukine were also shelled.
English Page The shelling left civilians dead and wounded, caused widespread damage and ignited many fires.
On Tuesday, 27 July 1993, the Israeli occupation forces continued their aggression.
From 0400 hours onwards, Israeli aircraft carried out raids on the Maidoun heights, on Mashgara, Mlita, Jabaa, Loueize, Jabal Safi, Ain Bossoir, Jarjou and Kfar Hatta in Iqlim al-Tuffah and on Harouf, Jibchit, Jabal al-Ahmar, Zawtar al-Sharqiye, Zawtar al-Gharbiye, Haris, Kfar Tibnit and Kfar Roumman in the central sector.
The raids were accompanied by heavy artillery shelling of most of the villages and towns of the south, especially the city of Nabatiye, on which hundreds of incendiary phosphorus bombs fell, making it impossible to count casualties and preventing ambulance teams from reaching them.
Shelling was also directed against most of the villages of Iqlim al-Tuffah and the towns and villages of the western Bekaa.
Positions of the international forces were exposed to Israeli raids and the positions of the Lebanese Army in Habbouch, Arabsalim, Maifadoun, Khartoum and Kfar Tibnit came under fire.
The number of casualties as of yesterday - Tuesday, 27 July 1993 - came to 53 dead and 200 wounded.
In addition, over a quarter of a million people have fled from southern Lebanon in the direction of Beirut.
I should be grateful if you would have this letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 35, and of the Security Council.

QUESTION OF CYPRUS
I have the honour to transmit herewith the letter addressed to you by His Excellency Mr. Osman Ertuğ, representative of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (see annex).

ANNEX
Letter dated 28 July 1993 from Mr. Osman Ertuğ
to the Secretary-General
I have the honour to refer to the recent violent demonstrations and acts of provocation perpetrated by Greek Cypriots in the United Nations-controlled Buffer Zone in Cyprus and at our borders, and to express the Turkish Cypriot side's indignation and concern at this new manifestation of Greek Cypriot hostility towards the Turkish Cypriot people.
As the spokesman of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) in Nicosia has also reported in his relevant statement issued on 26 July 1993, several hundred Greek Cypriots, most of them on motorcycles, staged violent demonstrations at a number of locations along the Buffer Zone on 25 July 1993.
Some of them broke through UNFICYP barriers and attacked UNFICYP personnel with rocks and other missiles, injuring a dozen of them and causing damage to United Nations property.
At three locations, the Greek Cypriot aggressors came within a short distance of our borders, and at "Dherinia", where they were joined by other groups bringing their number to about 2,000, they attacked members of the Turkish Cypriot Security Forces with rocks, "Molotov cocktails" and similar other missiles, at the same time hurling insults at them.
As a result, no fewer than 26 members of our Security Forces suffered injuries, and damage was caused to property.
The perpetrators also set part of the Buffer Zone on fire.
The demonstrations were reported to have been organized by "LOGOS" radio and television, an organ of the Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus, which is known for its militant, anti-Turkish stance, and by a Greek Cypriot youth organization.
However, in view of the fact that such acts of provocation are generally encouraged and supported by the Greek Cypriot authorities as a matter of policy, in order to create artificial tension in the island and keep the Cyprus issue high on the agenda of the international community, there can be no doubt that the recent incidents also had the blessing of the Greek Cypriot Administration.
The well-planned and organized nature of the incidents, the failure of the Greek Cypriot police to stop them and their refusal to cooperate with UNFICYP in containing the aggressive behaviour of the demonstrators testify to the above.
This is also borne out by the UNFICYP spokesman's above-mentioned statement, in which it is stated that "the maintenance of the integrity of the Buffer Zone is the responsibility of UNFICYP alone.
It requires also the full cooperation of the public at large and especially of the police authorities.
Such cooperation was clearly lacking yesterday".
By contrast, the restraint shown by the Turkish Cypriot Security Forces prevented these provocative incidents from turning into a wider confrontation, as again confirmed by the UNFICYP spokesman's statement in the following terms: "Had these events not been met by a conscientious response on the part of UNFICYP and restraint by the Forces on the Turkish Cypriot side, there could have been very serious consequences."
The manner in which the incidents were reported in the Greek Cypriot press the following day is also highly significant in terms of showing the public reaction and mentality prevalent on the Greek Cypriot side.
Headlines such as "Message From Our Youth - War With Attila"; "Our Youths Have Demonstrated Courage and a Fighting Spirit - A Blow to Attila"; "Hand-to-Hand Clash With the Invader"; and "It Is Faster to Kyrenia by Motorcycle" are the epitome of chauvinism and reveal the hostile intentions that the Greek Cypriots in general harbour against their Turkish Cypriot neighbours.
In fact, some of the slogans used by the demonstrators during these incidents leave no room for doubt as to what those intentions are: "Cyprus is Greek", "Attila out of Cyprus", "Turks are not our kin, they are our enemies", etc.
This latest demonstration of hostility on the part of the Greek Cypriot side is neither compatible with civilized, good-neighbourly relations nor with the establishment of trust between the two communities in Cyprus.
It clearly renders Your Excellency's efforts in that direction all the more difficult and sets the stage for more serious incidents in the future with unforeseen consequences.
I therefore hope that Your Excellency will do what you can to stop this harmful and dangerous trend on the Greek Cypriot side by impressing upon them that they alone will have to bear the responsibility for the consequences of their aggressive actions.
I shall be grateful if this letter is circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 45, and of the Security Council.

THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST
In reference to the letter dated 28 July 1993 from the Permanent Observer of Palestine (A/48/284-S/26191), I would like to state the following.
Lebanon appreciates the concern expressed by the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization over what is happening to the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, who are suffering along with the people of Lebanon under Israel's brutal onslaught.
Lebanon shares its feelings and is as concerned for these refugees as it is for its own citizens.
However, Lebanon cannot accept that the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization has taken it upon itself to call for immediate consideration of this matter by the Security Council.
Lebanon has already requested an urgent meeting of the Council, which is its exclusive right.
No party other than the Government of Lebanon and its Permanent Representative to the United Nations can call on the Council to discuss the issue of Israel's aggression against Lebanon.
This subject falls expressly within the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the Lebanese Government.
The request of the Permanent Observer of Palestine, although well intended, constitutes an interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation and State Member of the United Nations.
I should be grateful if you would have this letter circulated as a document of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 35, and of the Security Council.

THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST
Letter dated 30 July 1993 from the Permanent Representative
of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the
Secretary-General
Further to our recent letters concerning the large-scale Israeli assault on Lebanon, the last of which was issued as document A/47/992-S/26192, I regret to inform you that the Israeli Government has continued to implement its hostile plans today, for the sixth day in succession, in spite of repeated international appeals to halt its military operations over Lebanese territory.
Systematic and concentrated air raids and fierce artillery shelling have continued, completely destroying dozens of villages and causing half a million people to flee in the direction of Beirut and other areas to the north.
It seems clear from the statements of Israeli leaders and from the tragic situation in Lebanon that the new Israeli onslaught is aimed directly at innocent civilians and is designed to create a new "fact on the ground" that places a new burden on the shoulders of the debilitated State, thwarting the Lebanese Government's efforts and plans to build up its institutions and implement its reconstruction and development plans and undermining its achievements of the past two years.
As of 29 July 1993, Israel's scorched earth policy in southern Lebanon had left more than 110 dead and thousands wounded and had caused hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of damages to buildings, property and public utilities.
The tragic bloodshed of which the Lebanese people are the victims today has increased their determination to liberate their occupied territory.
It reaffirms the importance of ensuring that the Security Council fulfils its obligation to implement its resolution 425 (1978) and to end the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, which has been the root cause of the critical and explosive situation in that area for the past 15 years.
It is unacceptable that Israel and its military apparatus should be allowed to pursue its arrogant 93-43088 (E) 300793 300793 /... and destructive policy endlessly in southern Lebanon.
The facts confirm its failure to achieve the security aims it has been proclaiming over the years.
It would be more to the purpose to work for the implementation of international legitimacy, preserving Lebanon's sovereignty and providing security for the people living on both sides of the border.
That would imply a withdrawal by Israel to its international frontier with Lebanon, giving the Lebanese Government the opportunity to impose its authority in the south by means of its lawful forces, in cooperation with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
The following are the facts of the Israeli attacks on 28 and 29 July 1993:
- On 28 July, in the central sector of southern Lebanon, Israeli fighter aircraft and Cobra helicopters carried out scores of raids on villages in the area and on the town of Nabatiye, reducing parts of it to rubble.
Napalm was used in the raids, causing widespread fires.
Raids were directed against Douair, destroying homes and the mosque, Zawtar al-Charqiye, Zawtar al-Gharbiye, Haruf, Tibnine, Charqiye, whose mosque and school were destroyed, Zibdine, Kafr Sir, Maifadoun, Kafr Roumman, Choukine, Habbouch and Jibchit.
This was followed by heavy artillery shelling which caused heavy damage.
- In the region of Iqlim al-Tuffah, missiles fell on the woodland and on the villages of Jarjouh and Ain Bossoir, both of which were completely destroyed, Mlita, Jabal Safi, Arabsalim, Kfar Milke, Kfar Hata, Loueize, Houmine, Mlikh and Kafr Fila.
- In the Tyre area, the raids targeted not only homes but also shelters, reducing them to debris.
They were directed against the villages of Haris, Maaroub, Majdal Silm, Khirbat Silm, Qlaile, Adchit, Jouaiya, Bazouriye, Henniye, Qarie and Yatar.
The aircraft also targeted civilian cars carrying displaced persons between Chaabiye and Kafr Dounine, setting them and their passengers on fire.
Jibchit, Qaaqaaiyet al-Jisr, Braachit, Majdal Silm, Soultaniye, Haddatha, Aita al-Jabal, Qana and other villages were shelled by field artillery.
- In the Bekaa, aircraft carried out raids on the villages of Maidoun, Machghara, Ain al-Tine, Baiyade, Birket Jibour, Zillaya, Sohmor, Yohmor and Tallousse, turning their houses into rubble.
- In Sidon and its environs, the city and its outskirts were subjected to shelling by gunboats from the sea.
Dozens of shells fell on the area, claiming many victims, igniting fires and causing extensive damage to property.
In many cases, it was impossible to reach the victims because of intensive bombardment.
Moreover, ambulances were fired at by Israeli aircraft and helicopters.
- On 29 July 1993, the Israeli military machinery of destruction continued to attack villages in the central sector, using F-15 and F-16 aircraft and Cobra helicopters.
The town of Nabatiye was specially targeted, as were the villages of Habbouch, Ghassaniye, Ansar, Maifadoun and Charqiye.
Israeli aircraft continued to pursue civilian cars carrying displaced persons, setting them on fire and causing dozens of casualties. English Page
- In Iqlim al-Tuffah, villages were set on fire by phosphorus bombs and Jabaa, Ain Bossoir, Mlita, Kfar Milke, Kfar Hata, Kfar Fila, Houmine, Arabsalim and Ain Qana were subjected to artillery shelling and air raids.
- In the Bekaa, Israeli aircraft continued their operations against civilian homes and ambulances, causing deaths and injuries.
The artillery shelling was directed against the villages of Ain al-Tine, Maidoun, Jabal al-Zahr, Sohmor, Yohmor, Loueize, Qlaiya, Baiyade, Zillaya and Libbaya.
- In the Tyre and Bent Jbail area, Israeli aircraft used napalm in shelling Chaqra.
The bombing targeted a shelter housing more than 20 families in Majdal Silm, killing and wounding many.
Israeli raids also targeted positions of the Lebanese army in Ras al-Ain, killing one and wounding another.
The shelling of the villages of Mjeidil, Arzoun, Srifa, Chaabiye, Qabrikha, Jbal al-Botm, Jouaiya, Bazouriye, Qarie, Aitit, Soultaniye, Siddiquine, Adchit and Braachit left dozens of civilians dead and wounded.
In the Sidon area, Israeli aircraft continued their raids and flights over the city and its environs.
Missiles and bombs were directed against the camp of Ain al-Hilwe and villages east of Sidon and in the Naame hills.
This was accompanied by shelling from Israeli gunboats.
The Israeli forces are carrying out field tests of an Israeli-made air-to-surface missile, which is fired from Cobra helicopters.
It has been fired from a number of different heights and positions at civilian cars and fixed targets.
Today, 29 July 1993, there has been an increase in the ratio of civilian casualties and in the number of persons fleeing towards Beirut.

THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST
Letter dated 2 August 1993 from the Permanent Representative
of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the
Secretary-General
It is regrettable that the Permanent Observer of Palestine to the United Nations, in his letter (A/48/287-S/26201) dated 30 July 1993, saw fit once more to interfere in the internal affairs of Lebanon by reiterating his demand that the Security Council consider immediately the situation resulting from the Israeli aggression against Lebanon.
The Palestinian civilians, who live in the refugee camps and were subjected along with Lebanese civilians to Israel's savage and brutal attack, reside on Lebanese national soil.
Their presence in Lebanon and the regulation of their livelihood, including their safety and protection fall strictly within the jurisdiction of Lebanese law.
It is an accepted maxim of international law that every sovereign nation has the power, as is inherent in sovereignty and essential to self-preservation, to protect and safeguard the well-being of its citizens and all others who live on its territory.
Consequently, we reiterate the position of the Government of Lebanon that the matter of the Israeli aggression against Lebanon, and the convening of the Security Council to deal with it, remains the exclusive right of Lebanon because it falls totally within its jurisdiction and sovereignty.
I should be grateful if you would have the text of the present letter circulated as a document of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 35, and of the Security Council.

Letter dated 5 August 1993 from the Chargé d'Affaires a.i. of

addressed to the Secretary-General
I have the honour to transmit to you a letter from His Excellency Ernesto Leal, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Nicaragua (see annex), inviting you to appoint a mission to observe in situ the updating of the weapons inventories periodically carried out by the Nicaraguan army, an operation that the Nicaraguan Government sees as a further step in its policy of transparency in military affairs and as an additional confidence-building measure in the region.
The mission could visit Nicaragua during the last week of August 1993.

ANNEX
Letter dated 30 July 1993 from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua addressed to the Secretary-General
The Government of Nicaragua is deeply committed to the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America.
With that in view, we consider that the progress achieved in democratization and regional pacification should give rise to a vigorous and comprehensive process to reduce armaments and military forces with a view to establishing a reasonable balance of forces in the region.
As far as Nicaragua is concerned, this is one of the fundamental aims of the domestic and foreign policy of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
In this spirit, we have developed a series of domestic initiatives which have achieved substantial reductions in the army, as well as a decrease in armaments and the military budget.
With regard to foreign policy, we have promoted a series of initiatives within the framework of the Summit Meetings of the Central American Presidents and, in particular, through the Security Commission of the Central American countries, designed to restrict to a minimum the number of military and security forces and the quantity of weapons in the region.
Guided by its desire for peace, the Nicaraguan Government has on two occasions transmitted to you the inventory of military equipment, armaments and installations and the census of military and security forces personnel in the Republic of Nicaragua, in an effort to update periodically our military situation and cultivate a policy of complete transparency and commitment to the demilitarization of Central America.
We have also transmitted to you a report on transfers of weapons.
As a further demonstration of the Nicaraguan Government's desire for peace, we wish to invite you to appoint a mission to observe in situ the updating of the weapons inventories periodically carried out by the Nicaraguan army, an operation intended as a further step in our policy of transparency in military affairs and as an additional confidence-building measure in the region.
I am also requesting the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States to appoint a mission to participate jointly in this important task with the United Nations observers.
The mission could visit Nicaragua during the last week of August 1993.
I should like to express once again our gratitude for your continuing efforts to achieve stability and peace in Central America. Accept, Sir, the assurances of my highest consideration.

QUESTION OF CYPRUS
Letter dated 9 August 1993 from the Permanent Representative of
With reference to the letter dated 26 July 1993 from the Permanent Representative of Turkey and its annex (A/47/989-S/26170 and Corr.1), it is noted with regret that this is yet another instance of the abuse of the process of circulation of United Nations official documents by the Turkish Mission in the name of the so-called "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", an entity recognized by no member of the international community other than Turkey itself and which was rightly described in Security Council resolution 541 (1983) of 18 November 1983 as legally invalid and incompatible with the 1960 Treaty of Establishment and the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee.
The Security Council, in its resolution 550 (1984) of 11 May 1984, called upon all States "not to facilitate or in any way assist the aforesaid secessionist entity" and, as recently as 25 November 1992, in its resolution 789 (1992), it emphatically reaffirmed the aforesaid resolutions.
Yet, once again, we encounter the oxymoron of the Turkish Mission being allowed to abuse the right of a Member State to cause the circulation as United Nations official documents of communications emanating from that unrecognized entity, which the Security Council itself characterized and continues to regard as secessionist and legally invalid and which it called on all States not to facilitate or in any way assist.
This paradoxical situation is strongly protested and this abuse should not be allowed to continue.
Concerning the content of the letter of the Permanent Representative of Turkey and its annex purporting to cast doubt on the validity of my Government's application for accession to the European Community, this is effectively refuted by the Opinion of the Commission of the European Community on the Application of the Republic of Cyprus for membership issued on 30 June 1993.
93-45067 (E) 130893 /...
English Page legitimate Government representing the Cypriot people; and (b) "following the logic of its established position which is consistent with that of the United Nations where the legitimacy of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus and non-recognition of the 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' are concerned, felt the application was admissible and initiated the procedure laid down by the Treaties in order to examine it".
Furthermore, the Opinion states that the Commission is "convinced that the results of Cyprus's accession to the Community would be increased security and prosperity and that it would help bring the two communities on the Island together".
This is in full accord with my Government's long held and often repeated position and it unequivocally disposes of the further unfounded allegation in the letter under reply that the application poses an obstacle to the efforts for achieving a solution to the Cyprus problem.
The Government of the Republic of Cyprus, far from putting obstacles in the path of the negotiations for the just, workable and lasting solution of the Cyprus problem, has consistently done its utmost to cooperate and facilitate your tenacious and indefatigable efforts towards that end.
It is not only unfounded but also provocative to allege, as the authors of the letter under reply do, that there is lack of political will on the part of the Greek Cypriot side for a negotiated solution when it is well established and universally recognized by the members of the Security Council and all those who follow the developments concerning the Cyprus problem that the lack of progress is due to the Turkish intransigence and lack of cooperation.
This is documented in a plethora of official reports to the Security Council.
Suffice it to recall paragraph 49 of your latest report (S/26026 of 1 July 1993), where it is stated:
"I am disappointed that, despite the assurance he gave on 1 June in the presence of the President of the Security Council and the representatives of its five permanent members, Mr. Denktaş did not promote the acceptance of the package during his consultations in Nicosia and Ankara.
I also deeply regret that Mr. Denktaş failed to honour the agreement of 1 June to resume the joint meetings on 14 June",
which provides the measure of who is to blame for the lack of progress in the ongoing negotiations.
It is evident from the above that the application of the Republic of Cyprus for accession to the European Community was submitted by its legitimate Government recognized by the United Nations and the entire international community, with the sole exception of Turkey.
As such the Government of Cyprus is duly entitled and fully competent to submit the application and proceed with the process of accession, which will be indisputably to the best interest of all Cypriots.
It is still to be hoped that, bearing in mind the justified impatience of the international community at the lack of progress towards the solution of the Cyprus problem, Ankara and the Turkish Cypriot leadership will revise their so far intransigent attitude and at long last respond positively to your efforts.
It is significant that in the Opinion referred to above it is stated that:
"The Commission must envisage the possibility of the failure of the intercommunal talks to produce a political settlement of the Cyprus question in the foreseeable future, in spite of the endeavours of the United Nations Secretary-General.
Should this eventuality arise the Commission feels that the situation should be reassessed in view of the positions adopted by each party in the talks and that the question of Cyprus's accession to the Community should be reconsidered in January 1995".
My Government is convinced that a just, workable and lasting solution to the Cyprus problem is to the benefit of all concerned, certainly of the whole people of Cyprus who have suffered for too long, of the United Nations, which devoted much time and effort over the years, of peace in the region and, not least, of Turkey itself.
We submit that this is the constructive way to view the situation and not by negative and contentious actions as we have witnessed too often.
I should be grateful if the text of the present letter could be circulated as a document of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 45, and of the Security Council.

QUESTION OF CYPRUS
Letter dated 10 August 1993 from the Permanent Representative of
Cyprus to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
I have the honour to refer to our previous communications (A/47/536-S/24667 and A/47/856-S/25063) concerning the demographic structure of the Cypriot communities and the continuing, systematic and planned implantation of Turkish settlers in the occupied areas of Cyprus, and to inform you that the illegal regime in the occupied areas of Cyprus has now "decided" to proceed with the "naturalization" of 5,000 Turkish settlers.
More specifically on the basis of Turkish-Cypriot newspaper reports (Yeniduzen, 5 August 1993) and public statements, it has been made known that the illegal regime in the occupied areas of Cyprus has "decided" to proceed with the "naturalization" of 5,000 settlers in view of the forthcoming "elections" in the occupied areas.
This blatant disregard of international legality is clearly directed not only against the interests of the people of Cyprus as a whole but additionally demonstrates the means and ends that the illegal occupation "regime" is willing to use and go to, even against the interests of the Turkish-Cypriots themselves, in order to promote its political objectives and designs.
This latest manifestation of illegality has come under very strong criticism by a number of Turkish-Cypriot politicians (Messrs Ozgur, Akinci and Atun) who characterized it as one more effort to change the demographic structure of the occupied areas and the political will of the Turkish-Cypriot community.
As we have repeatedly stated in the past, there has been a deliberate and systematic attempt by the Turkish side, which still continues unabated, to alter the demographic structure of the Republic of Cyprus through the implantation of Turkish settlers who, to date, have reached the number of 80,000 to 85,000 persons.
The effects of the implantation of such a large number of settlers become all the more significant and worrisome if one bears in mind that the size of the Turkish-Cypriot community has continuously, throughout this period,
93-44527 (E) 110893 /...
English Page diminished by more than one third its original size (approximately 115,000 in 1974), thus making it quite clear that this illegal policy and its negative consequences are not only directed against the Greek-Cypriot community but also against the Turkish-Cypriot community.
As will be recalled from our previous communication of 15 October 1992 (A/47/536-S/24667), the issue of the alteration of the demographic structure of Cyprus was examined by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which adopted a relevant resolution on 7 October 1992, following a report of its Committee on Migration, Refugees and Demography.
This report was prepared by a special rapporteur on the subject, Mr. Alfons Cuco (Spain), who visited Cyprus and examined the problem on the spot.
To quote from the resolution, the Council of Europe determined that "the presence and naturalization of the Turkish migrants, who once established on the island become settlers, constitute an additional obstacle to a peaceful, negotiated solution of the Cypriot conflict" (para. 8).
In concluding, let me reiterate our conviction that the solution of the Cyprus problem can only be achieved through the respect of international legality, the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions and the manifestation, in a practical manner, of good will in your efforts to achieve a viable, just and workable solution.
The Turkish policy of confronting the whole world with new and additional "faits accomplis" and the intransigence and bad faith shown in the course of the negotiations cannot but further exacerbate the situation and make the solution of the Cyprus problem all the more difficult to achieve.
I should be grateful if the text of the present letter could be circulated as a document of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 45, and of the Security Council.

The reports of these meetings are contained in document A/CONF.157/24/Part II.
On 25 June 1993, the World Conference on Human Rights adopted by acclamation its final document, entitled "Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action", which will be reproduced in the report to be submitted by the Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session pursuant to Assembly resolution 47/122 of 18 December 1992.
On the same day, a special declaration on Angola was adopted without a vote (see A/CONF.157/24/Part I).
In addition, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action contains several recommendations to be considered by the General Assembly.
Among these, the Secretary-General and the General Assembly were requested to take immediate steps to increase substantially the resources for the human rights programme from within the existing and future regular budgets of the United Nations, as well as to take urgent steps to seek increased extra-budgetary resources.
The Secretary-General and the Assembly were further requested to provide sufficient human, financial and other resources to the Centre for Human Rights to enable it effectively, efficiently and expeditiously to carry out its activities.
In this context, Member States were also urged to adopt a coherent approach aimed at securing resources commensurate to the increased mandates on human rights allocated to the Secretariat.
The World Conference on Human Rights further invited the Secretary-General to consider whether adjustments to procedures in the programme budget cycle would be necessary or helpful to ensure the timely and effective implementation of human rights activities as mandated by Member States.
In addition, the World Conference on Human Rights recommended to the General Assembly that when examining the report of the Conference at its forty-eighth session, it begin, as a matter of priority, consideration of the question of the establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights for the promotion and protection of all human rights.
In the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action the World Conference further recommended that the General Assembly proclaim an international decade of the world's indigenous people to begin from January 1994, including action-oriented programmes to be decided upon in partnership with indigenous people.
The proclamation of a United Nations decade for human rights education in order to promote, encourage and focus educational activities should be considered.
The Conference also recommended that the General Assembly consider the possibility of proclaiming a United Nations decade for human rights.
With regard to the human rights of women, the World Conference called upon the General Assembly to adopt the draft declaration on violence against women, and States were urged to combat violence against women in accordance with its provisions.
The World Conference also called upon the General Assembly to adopt the draft standard rules on the equalization of opportunities for persons with disabilities at its meeting in 1993.
With regard to the follow-up, the World Conference recommended that the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and other organs and agencies of the United Nations system related to human rights consider ways and means for the full implementation, without delay, of the recommendations contained in its Declaration.
In this context, the Secretary-General of the United Nations was requested to invite, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, all States and all organs and agencies of the United Nations system related to human rights to report to him on the progress made in the implementation of the Declaration and to submit a report to the Assembly at its fifty-third session, through the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council.
The General Assembly will have before it a report on the outcome of the World Conference prepared in accordance with General Assembly resolution 47/122.
The full report of the World Conference will be circulated as document A/CONF.157/24.

In recognition of his distinguished service as the Chairman of the Committee on Contributions for 27 years, the Committee decided to recommend to the General Assembly that it appoint Syed Amjad Ali as member emeritus of the Committee on Contributions.
II. TERMS OF REFERENCE
4. In the absence of a mandate emanating from the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, the Committee conducted its work on the basis of its general mandate, as contained in rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, and the mandate contained in General Assembly resolutions 46/221 A to D of 20 December 1991.
5. The Committee also had before it General Assembly decision 47/456 of 23 December 1992, the summary records of the Fifth Committee relating to agenda item 111, Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations (A/C.5/47/SR.17-20, 23-27, 36-38, 44, 45, 50, 52 and 67) and the relevant report of the Fifth Committee to the General Assembly (A/47/833 and Add.1).
III. REPRESENTATIONS OF MEMBER STATES
A. Representations
7. Invoking rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the Republic of Moldova stresses the unsuitability of the statistics of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for the determination of its rate of assessment.
They consider the statistics inflated and unrepresentative of Moldova's current capacity to pay.
The representation also notes the artificiality of the exchange rate used in the conversion of national income to United States dollars, requesting instead the use of rates recently calculated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Questioning the ability of the present scale methodology to respond to the exceptional situation created by the emergence of the newly independent States, Moldova requests establishment of its rate of assessment on the basis of its present capacity to pay instead of the mechanical division of the rate of assessment of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
The representation includes two statistical tables and a request for payment of part of regular budget assessment in national currency.
8. The Czech Republic draws attention to the unrealistic exchange rate and the inflated nature of the national income data used in determining the rate of assessment of the former Czechoslovakia.
It stresses the negative impact on its economic situation of the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy and two koruna devaluations.
The Government appeals to the Committee on Contributions for calculation of its rate of assessment on the basis of data provided to the United Nations Statistical Division (Statistical Division) and recently calculated IMF exchange rates and taking into account the information on current economic indicators appended to the representation.
The Czech Republic requests to be assessed as a new Member State.
9. Invoking rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, Armenia states that national income statistics from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics do not reflect accurately its capacity to pay.
The Government requests review of its assessment rate on the basis of data provided to the Statistical Division and notes the artificiality of the exchange rates of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
It also points out the lack of correspondence between Armenia's current rate of assessment and its capacity to pay and asks the Committee to take into consideration its severe economic problem due to structural changes and political instability in the area among other factors.
National income and population data are appended to the representation.
* Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.
Charter that the United Nations is based on the sovereign equality of all its Members when, in determining the present assessment rates for the 12 new Member States, including Latvia, which are located in the territory that until 1991 was controlled by the former United Soviet Socialist Republics, it did not respect the juridical equality of States in deciding assessment rates for all Members.
In addition, the General Assembly did not respect the personality of the Baltic States, including Latvia, in that they are not successor States to the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics".
11. The Government notes that "the General Assembly of the United Nations did not assess the 12 new Member States, including Latvia, in accordance with the principle of 'broadly according to capacity to pay' as required by rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, in that it did not use market exchange rates, as has been the practice for most other States, and it applied the scheme of limits in calculating the assessment rates for the 12 new Member States, including Latvia, as has not been the practice for other new Member States".
Furthermore, the Government makes a case for reviewing the assessment rates for 1989-1994.
The Statistical Division has been provided with national income and population data as well as IMF exchange rates for Latvia.
12. In its first representation, Ukraine invokes rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly and requests establishment of a fair rate of assessment based on its own national income data and exchange rates specially calculated by IMF.
It notes that, as confirmed by the United Nations Legal Counsel, by opting for a mechanical redistribution of the contribution of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Committee on Contributions effectively abandoned important principles and criteria underlying the existing procedures for determining the scale of assessments.
The Government notes further that the decision to increase Ukraine's rate coincided with the reduction in its capacity to pay resulting, inter alia, from the effects of economic reforms and the consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
Reference is made to the inflated national income data and unrealistic exchange rates underlying the assessment rate of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Ukraine's unwillingness to suffer the consequences of that State's policies.
Reference is also made to Ukraine's letter to the Secretary-General informing him that it would pay its contributions to the United Nations at the rate adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 46/221 A of 20 December 1991.
National income data and IMF exchange rates are appended to the representation.
13. Ukraine's second representation details its economic losses resulting from the implementation of Security Council resolutions on sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and requests consideration of this factor by the Committee on Contributions.
14. The joint representation by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan focuses on the shared views of these States with regard to the request for review of their current assessment rates that do not correspond to their capacity to pay.
The 14 States emphasize that the application of the scheme of limits and the 10-year statistical base period prevent the proper determination of their assessment rates in accordance with the principle of the capacity to pay.
15. Invoking rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, Estonia requests assessment on the basis of sovereign statistics, economically sound foreign exchange rates and equal application of the scale methodology rather than the ad hoc distribution of the rate of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics currently in effect.
The representation emphasizes that Estonia was an annexed and occupied country, that it never was a part of, and is not a successor to the rights or obligations of, the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
The Government would also like to limit the question of transition issues, referred to in paragraph 70 of the Committee's report to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session, Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-seventh Session, Supplement No. 11 (A/47/11).
The representation asks for recognition of the severe restrictions on Estonia's capacity to pay during its transition from a centrally planned to a market economy.
It also refers to the sovereign national income and population statistics provided to the Statistical Division and the exchange rates available from IMF.
16. With reference to rule 160 of the rules of procedure, the Slovak Republic as one of the two successor States of the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic requests determination of its assessment rate on the basis of its current capacity to pay.
The representation notes that the arbitrarily set exchange rates of the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, among other factors, resulted in an assessment rate for the former State which exceeded its capacity to pay.
It also notes the reduced capacity to pay of the Slovak Republic resulting from the effects of transition to a market economy and the limited capacity to acquire convertible currency.
Numerous tables with statistical information are attached to the representation.
17. With reference to rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, Kazakhstan appeals for a change of its rate of assessment on the basis of recent statistics and IMF exchange rates, citing its doubts about the representativeness of the national income data and exchange rates used in the calculation of the rate for the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
Kazakhstan's current economic difficulties and shortage of foreign currency are described, which affect its capacity to pay at a critical stage in the transition period.
The Government endorses the conclusions of the Ogata-Volcker report Financing an Effective United Nations (A report of the Independent Advisory Group on United Nations Financing), a project of the Ford Foundation, New York, February 1993. concerning the scale methodology.
18. Citing rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, Belarus appeals for a change of its assessment rate for 1993 and 1994 in view of the calamitous deterioration of its capacity to pay.
In that letter, serious doubt is expressed about the validity and justification of the Committee's recommendation to increase the assessment rate of Belarus by more than 50 per cent.
Further annexes to the representation contain updated national income data and exchange rates and an IMF aide-mémoire on the calculation of rouble exchange rates.
19. Invoking rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, Lithuania reiterates its position that the rates of assessment must be achieved through the use of sovereign national statistics and reliable, verifiable data and must, to the greatest extent possible, reflect accurately a Member State's capacity to pay.
As the rates adopted by General Assembly decision 47/456 were not based on data provided by Lithuania, relied on unrealistic exchange rates and were not calculated from the ground up, the Government requests a review of its rate on the basis of national income and population data and IMF exchange rates provided to the United Nations.
20. Azerbaijan's representation refers to rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly and states that it has never claimed to be a successor to the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and, therefore, should be assessed independently, without reference to the contribution of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
The Government points out the use of statistics unreflective of its capacity to pay and of artificial exchange rates in the calculation of the assessment rate of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
It appeals for a reconsideration of its rate in light of these circumstances and of its sharply declined capacity owing to the difficulties arising from the economic transition, the ongoing war, the lack of foreign currency and the refugee problem.
B. Other information considered
21. The Committee also had before it a note by the Statistical Division dealing with national income and related data for the Member States previously belonging to the former Czechoslovakia, the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the former Yugoslavia ("the 22 Member States"*).
The note describes the quality of the data available for these countries and the efforts undertaken by several international organizations in cooperation with them to improve the data quality and reorient the statistical system in transition economies.
The note also contains summary tables for each of the 22 Member States concerned of processed data or estimates used in the derivation of the assessment rates distinguishing between both types of data and data sources and reflecting, inter alia, the data received directly from the Governments of these States.
It also describes the criteria and procedures followed in processing the data and in dealing with conflicting data.
22. In particular, the note draws the attention of Committee members to a number of conceptual and practical problems to be considered in evaluating the national income statistics of the countries concerned which go beyond the inherent differences between estimates based on the Material Product System (MPS) and the System of National Accounts (SNA).
They affect the comparability of national income data among the 22 Member States concerned and between them and other States, as well as the comparability of data for the same State before and after the dissolution of the former consolidated States.
For the new estimates, there is no guarantee that the processing of the data is carried out according to the same compilation criteria that were used centrally before.
This may explain why the estimates, when added together, do not necessarily add up to the previous totals for the former consolidated States and also explains the existence of sometimes more than one estimate for these States, each of which is based on different compilation criteria.
Thus, even if the estimates are of high quality, they are not necessarily comparable with the data previously processed centrally or comparable with data of other States in this category.
23. However, the most serious problem faced in the interpretation of data for the 22 Member States concerns exchange rates.
In fact, the internal study of IMF on quota calculations for the republics of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics employs such different foreign exchange rate patterns.
24. In addition to general and specific references to the IMF rates and requests for their use by the Committee in several representations, the Committee was provided by IMF, at the request of Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine,
For its own purposes, IMF calculated rates for 1985 and 1990 and made extrapolations for the other years at the request of the States concerned.
25. In the note by the Statistical Division, it is pointed out that under the IMF method many assumptions were made about conversion rates for a large part of foreign trade and for trade between the former republics.
The note concluded that it was difficult to justify individual exchange rates for the former republics for years prior to the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that are different from the former official rates.
Such rates are not strictly comparable with the IMF rates used for other countries.
26. The Committee was informed by IMF that the IMF rates for the States of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for years prior to dissolution were the same for all of them and served research and quota calculation purposes only.
The Committee was further informed that IMF did not intend to develop these rates further and would not publish them in the IMF International Financial Statistics, the source of the exchange rates used by the Committee in its work, as they do not meet IMF's statistical standards.
C. Discussion
27. The written and oral representations and related information described above enabled the Committee to understand better the complex political, legal, economic and technical issues underlying the concerns of the 22 Member States in question about the level of the assessment rates of the former consolidated States, about the manner in which those rates were distributed and about the perceived discrepancies between their individual rates of assessment and their current capacity to pay.
The Committee also examined the representations of these States with regard to some of the components of the scale methodology, in particular the length of the statistical base period, the exchange rates and the application of the scheme of limits.
28. The Committee sympathized with many of the concerns expressed.
However, it did not feel competent in terms of its mandate to deal with the political and legal issues raised.
After lengthy discussion of the individual representations, the Committee concluded that a determination of assessment rates for the 22 Member States that better reflect their current capacity to pay could only be achieved in the context of a new scale of assessments.
Notwithstanding the provisions of rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the Committee noted that it did not have a specific mandate from the General Assembly to do so this year.
29. The only other way of addressing the representations would be to reduce individual rates of assessment through mitigation.
However, providing relief through mitigation posed serious problems.
Mitigation would not address positions of principle held by several of the 22 Member States.
Furthermore, mitigation is a tool for fine-tuning a new scale and is subject to a set of guidelines.
The willingness to make points available for that purpose generally is limited to the overall context of formulating a new scale.
Committee members were also concerned about creating new distortions through ad hoc adjustments.
The Committee concluded that the most balanced result for the largest number of Member States would not be achieved through preferential treatment of the 22 Member States but rather through modification of the scale methodology for the preparation of the next scale of assessments.
30. Some members expressed the view that the 22 Member States, or at least a majority of them, should be assessed in the next scale as if they were new Member States.
Other members cast doubt on this approach in view of the legal, political and financial problems it raises as such approach entails negative impact on the rates of assessment of other Member States, particularly developing countries.
IV. SCALE METHODOLOGY
31. Guided by the General Assembly mandate contained in resolution 46/221 B, the Committee carefully reviewed all components of the current scale methodology in preparation for the calculation of the next scale of assessments.
It also considered the possibility of preparing the next scale on the basis of a new approach.
In doing so, the Committee also was mindful of the need to address in a technical and practical manner the special problems of the 22 Member States.
A. Current methodology
32. For the review of the current scale methodology, its components were divided into three areas: income concepts; conversion of national income to United States dollars; and other elements, that is, statistical base period, low per capita income allowance and scheme of limits.
The Committee followed this approach in order to draw a clearer distinction than before between those components based on mainstream technical concepts and those largely based on non-technical considerations that are considered important in the United Nations context.
In view of the provisions contained in paragraphs 3 and 5 of General Assembly resolution 46/221 B, the Committee did not discuss debt adjustment, ceiling, floor and the provision for the least developed countries.
33. Owing to time constraints and the fact that the necessary data were not available, the Committee was not in a position to deal with the mandate contained in paragraph 7 (c) of resolution 46/221 B but decided to continue its work in this area.
1. Income concepts
34. National income, defined as a country's GDP plus net factor income from the rest of the world and minus consumption of fixed capital, has been the cornerstone of the scale methodology since 1945.
Its ability to reflect the capacity to pay of Member States has been challenged equally long.
The Committee recalled its work over the years to define adjustments for GDP that would better reflect the capacity to pay.
Extensive efforts in the early 1980s to identify and incorporate into the methodology social and economic indicators were abandoned after several years owing to insurmountable technical and other problems encountered in the process of identifying suitable indicators, establishing acceptable standards for specific indicators, generating the necessary statistics and defining appropriate GDP adjustment factors.
Cost-benefit concerns added to the difficulties.
35. Since the late 1980s, the Committee has concentrated its efforts in this area on the examination of alternative income concepts.
In the preparation of the last two scales, it has employed an alternative income concept by adjusting downward the national incomes of countries with annual per capita national incomes below $6,000 For the debt adjustments in the last two scales, World Bank debt stock data were used.
and burdened by large amounts of external debt. The conceptual problem inherent in this adjustment is that the deduction of debt from national income does not result in an income concept defined in international standards.
36. Other alternative income concepts considered by the Committee over the years include monetary income, disposable income, income adjusted for changes in national wealth and sustainable income.
37. Monetary income is defined as national income minus imputed income of subsistence production in agriculture and other activities.
Income measurement based on this concept would benefit low income countries with large subsistence economies.
However, the concept is not well developed, is not included in international statistical standards and is difficult to quantify.
38. Disposable income is defined as national income plus current transfers from abroad minus transfers paid to other countries, which include mainly transfers of revenues of resident migrant workers from their host country to their home country (i.e., country of citizenship), as well as some of the government expenditures made to maintain large numbers of refugees who are temporarily residing in the country.
While conceptually sound, included in the international guidelines on SNA and having the same data availability as national income, the concept is little used internationally.
It would reflect better the assessable income of countries with large numbers of non-resident migrant workers employed in the country or resident workers employed abroad as well as countries with large numbers of refugees staying in the country.
39. Income adjusted for changes in national wealth is defined as national income minus the interest cost of investments needed to replace capital assets damaged or lost as a result of natural or man-made disasters.
The concept has not been well developed nor made operational; it is not included in international statistical standards and statistics are not readily available.
The concept would have impact only for countries that have suffered large capital losses as a result of the effects of natural or man-made disasters.
40. Sustainable income is defined as national income minus expenditures required to sustain such income into the future.
The concept is not elaborated operationally; it is not available in international statistical standards, and the availability of statistics would depend on how it is elaborated conceptually.
If further elaborated, the concept could address the need expressed by some Member States for an adjustment of national income to compensate for deficiencies in a country's social and economic development (e.g., lack of health or education facilities, housing, transportation systems).
Discussion
41. The discussion of alternative income concepts revealed a wide range of diverging views among Committee members.
From a technical point of view, the Committee still considers the national income concept to be more sound than other income concepts for the purposes of the scale of assessments notwithstanding the use of debt-adjusted income in past or future scales.
The members agreed, however, that the alternative income concepts discussed above should be kept under consideration and their possible use reviewed periodically.
2. Conversion rates
42. The starting point for the calculation of the scale of assessments is a percentage distribution of national incomes expressed in United States dollars.
Therefore, the size of a country's national income in relation to that of all other countries may be correctly measured or under- or overstated depending on whether or not the conversion rate used is determined by market forces, is used for the majority of that country's economic and financial transactions, and reflects well relative price changes over time.
43. Precipitated by the concerns expressed in the representations, the discussion of United Nations operational rates in the Committee, the recent IMF study on purchasing power parities and as part of its ongoing work, the Committee once again reviewed in detail the advantages and disadvantages of different alternative conversion rates, namely market exchange rate (MER), price-adjusted rate of exchange (PARE), purchasing power parity (PPP) and the World Atlas rate (WA).
44. Market exchange rates are used for transactions in goods and services traded internationally and in other payments and receipts between countries.
They reflect relative prices of goods and services between countries and also other international transactions, such as foreign investments and loans, payments and receipts of investment income and transfer of workers' remittances, current and capital transfers, as well as by interest rates and expectations of financial markets.
The use of MERs for calculating the scale has the advantage of being the same type of rate that is used for the calculation of the payment of assessed contributions.
For countries with convertible currencies, MERs are generally adequate conversion rates.
They may be less suitable, inter alia, for countries whose currencies are not convertible.
The Committee has used the MERs included by IMF in its International Financial Statistics.
Data are available for all countries except non-IMF members.
All MERs published by IMF satisfy standards of international comparability.
45. Price-adjusted rates of exchange were developed by the Statistical Division in response to distortions in United States dollar values of the national incomes of countries with fixed, controlled exchange rates and/or rates that exist under circumstances of high inflation.
PAREs are defined as exchange rates for base periods that are adjusted for earlier or later years with the help of price indices reflecting inflation.
During the base period, the MER and the PARE are identical.
Subsequently, PARE and MER deviate when exchange rates and domestic prices develop differently.
PAREs smooth out the effects of high rates of inflation and volatile movements of exchange rates over time.
They provide stability over time in per capita income time series.
Illustrative calculations have shown that their application does not drastically change the distribution of national incomes among Member States as long as the PARE rates are based on exchange rates which prevail during the base period.
46. Except for questions that remain about the suitability of the base period used, PAREs are conceptually sufficiently well developed for the purposes of the scale of assessments.
A long base period might help in assuring its suitability.
An advantage of using PARE is the decreased fluctuation of national and per capita income over time and the opportunity to work with a shorter statistical base period.
Although they are not included in international statistical standards, the necessary statistics are readily available at the Statistical Division.
It was noted, however, that PARE can only serve assessment purposes and not the purpose of actual payments.
47. A purchasing power parity for a country is defined as the number of units of a country's currency required to buy the same amount of goods and services in the domestic market as one dollar would buy in the United States.
Cross-country comparisons of GDP based on PPP conversions reflect differences in quantities of goods and services and are free of price-level differentials.
In other words, PPPs focus on what goods and services a country's GDP will buy compared with the purchasing power of other countries' GDP rather than on valuing each country's output in goods and services in United States dollars using international exchange rates.
Thus, the weakening or strengthening of national currencies in relation to the United States dollar does not lead immediately to the shrinking or expansion of national economies in relation to that of the United States.
For the purposes of the scale, the use of PPPs could result in significant changes in the current distribution of national incomes based on MERs.
48. PPPs are conceptually well developed and are used by several international and regional organizations for analytical purposes and by some regional organizations for policy purposes.
However, in the view of several members of the United Nations Statistical Commission, they have not yet been adequately developed to serve policy purposes at a global level.
Also, PPPs are more relevant for international product than income comparisons such as those made for the scale.
The concept rests on the assumption that the goods and services selected for comparison are actually comparable in the different countries.
The necessary statistics are collected every five years for a limited number of countries.
Extrapolations carried out by researchers have made it possible to increase considerably the universe of countries for which PPPs are available.
49. The WA rate is the average of the last annual MER and two PARE rates which are exchange rates of the last two years that are updated to the present year with the help of price indices.
Over time, they are more or less comparable to MERs, whereas for individual years they tend to fluctuate somewhat less than MERs.
WA is conceptually sound and is more relevant for international comparisons of income than PPPs.
It is used currently by the World Bank (World Atlas) and UNDP (indicative planning figure).
While not covered in international statistical standards, statistics are available annually for the countries covered in the World Atlas.
50. In the discussion of the different conversion rates, Committee members tried to come to terms with their varying conceptual and data limitations, on the one hand, and the degree to which they provide accurate and stable income measures over time, on the other.
There was fairly general agreement that the problems interpreting the data, of data availability and the cost of data generation at this point outweighed the intriguing conceptual characteristics of PPPs such as greater stability in income distributions among countries which would allow shortening of the statistical base period.
Concern also was expressed about the concept's appropriateness for international income comparison and the initial turbulent impact its use would have on the distribution of national incomes for scale purposes.
Those who questioned the use of PPPs for the scale stressed that PPPs are currently applied only for analytical, research and limited policy purposes.
Even IMF continues to publish and use MERs.
51. With WAs not being significantly different from MERs over time and in view of the latter's more universal coverage, the question of the most appropriate conversion rate is reduced to a choice between MERs and PARE.
For application in the immediate future, the Committee believes that it would be most appropriate to continue using MERs despite the temporary problems connected with the countries whose economies are in transition from a centrally planned to a market economy and the periodic problems with exchange rates that are fixed or controlled or exist under circumstances of high inflation.
The Committee arrived at this conclusion in recognition of the guidelines set out in paragraph 3 (b) of resolution 46/221 B. It did so also in view of the need for further study and refinement of mechanisms that could be employed to adjust for any incompatibility between PAREs and exchange rates in the base period and between PARE and exchange rate movements over time.
Meanwhile, PARE could be used to correct exchange rate distortions for selected countries as had been done in the past.
3. Other elements
a. Statistical base period
52. The Committee recalled the reasons for changing the length of the statistical base period which had been considered at various times in the past.
The length of the statistical base period in the current scale methodology is the strongest guarantor of stability over time averaging out national income fluctuations.
However, at its present length, it is indicative of past rather than present capacity to pay of Member States.
53. In its discussion on this element, Committee members recalled the General Assembly's disposition to retain the 10-year statistical base period as reflected in paragraph 3 (a) of resolution 46/221 B. They also drew attention to the perceived link between the statistical base period and the scheme of limits.
Some argued that, in view of paragraphs 2 and 3 of resolution 46/221 B, concerning the phasing out of the scheme of limits over two three-year scale periods, it would be prudent to retain a long base period in order to avoid excessive fluctuations in the scale.
Others pointed out that the economic problems currently faced by some Member States, including the 22 Member States, and the issue of appropriate exchange rates for the years prior to dissolution by the former consolidated States represented sound reasons for reducing the base period regardless of the phasing out of the scheme of limits.
In view of these conflicting interests, a gradual reduction in the length of the scale period was suggested.
In this connection, the Committee considered that a statistical base period of nine years was technically superior to the current 10 years.
b. Low per capita income allowance
54. The adjustment of national income on the basis of low per capita income provides relief to many developing countries, especially those with very large populations.
The parameters for this adjustment mechanism have been adjusted upward many times by the General Assembly.
Most recently, as indicated in paragraphs 2 and 3 (d) of resolution 46/221 B, the General Assembly considered in principle that the low per capita income allowance should be an integral and automatic adjustment mechanism and requested commentary and analysis on a per capita income limit of the average world per capita income and a gradient of 100 per cent.
Some members noted that any automatic adjustment of the per capita income limit should be based on a 10-year average world per capita income, independent of the length of the statistical base period used in the scale of assessments.
Other members observed that the problem implicit in footnote 5 applied here.
The view was also expressed that the statistical base period and the period used for the calculation of the average world per capita income should coincide.
55. The opinion of Committee members remained divided on the appropriateness of a 100 per cent gradient.
The gradient defines the proportion of the percentage difference between a country's per capita national income and the per capita income limit by which a country's national income is reduced to its assessable income.
Some consider it an appropriate response to easing the burden of developing countries which are faced with negative resource transfers, external debt and widespread poverty.
Others observed that the use of a 100 per cent gradient creates additional distortions in the reflection of the capacity to pay of Member States.
In the view of the latter members, any increase in the existing percentage gradient would benefit mainly a very limited number of developing countries with large populations and large economies and a few large middle income countries without any appreciable benefits to the great majority of developing countries that have small economies.
This is especially so as there are 45 developing countries which are classified as least developed countries and do not benefit from the low per capita income allowance.
They noted that the gradient increase failed to take care adequately of the concerns of the 22 Member States.
They also were of the opinion that there is no technical justification for selecting one percentage gradient rather than another.
Others felt that paragraph 3 (d) of resolution 46/221 B should be strictly adhered to.
c. Scheme of limits
56. The Committee was informed that, from a technical point of view, a situation could be reached soon in which a 100 per cent scale no longer would be possible without changing the scheme's present parameters.
However, suitably constructed, a scheme could still be useful for transition from the present methodology to one with modified components or a radically different methodology.
In annexes I to III of its report to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session, 1/ the Committee provided illustrative tables demonstrating the effects of three different methods for phasing out the scheme of limits.
57. As on previous occasions, some Committee members commented on the perceived distorting effect of the scheme of limits.
However, other members pointed out that all adjustments made to national income create distortions compounded further by the mitigation process.
As indicated in paragraph 53 above, the Committee was aware of the General Assembly's intention to phase out the scheme of limits.
Some members considered that the General Assembly's intention has assumed increased significance in the light of article 17 of the Charter and rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly and the desire of the 22 Member States to be assessed as quickly as possible at a level which corresponds to their capacity to pay.
Some expressed the view that the adverse effects of the scheme of limits are almost entirely limited to countries in Eastern Europe and the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, while some developed countries are the principal beneficiaries.
58. At the same time, some members noted that the partial or complete elimination of the scheme of limits would result in significant changes in the assessment rates of some Member States.
This circumstance was of great concern to some members of the Committee as developing countries would be affected as well.
Others were of the opinion that, as the economies of some developing countries had grown significantly over the past few years, they could not continue to be protected from increased rates of assessment without creating inequity for other countries.
Some other members expressed concern that the phasing out of the scheme of limits and a shortening of the base period might, in the not-too-distant future, adversely affect the interests of those developing countries whose economies would grow rapidly, including some of the 22 Member States whose economies are in transition.
At the same time, countries members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with declining economies would benefit.
59. In this connection, the Committee also was aware of the General Assembly's request to the Committee to examine ways and means to minimize, to the extent possible, the allocation of additional points to developing countries that were benefiting from application of the scheme of limits, in the first six years of the post-transition period.
Some members expressed the view that this could only be achieved by prohibiting the allocation of such additional points to this group of countries.
B. Adjustment of the methodology
60. The Committee engaged in lengthy discussions on the most appropriate manner in which to modify the existing methodology so as to be responsive both to the mandates contained in General Assembly resolution 46/221 B and the need to align the assessment rates of the 22 Member States more closely with their capacity to pay.
It was generally felt that, while the Committee on Contributions had always striven to combine improvements in the methodology with maximum stability in the scale of assessments, that goal could be harder to achieve in future because of the changes in the world and in the United Nations.
Views on possible solutions diverged widely ranging from the approach envisaged in resolution 46/221 B to a scale of assessments based on the distribution of national income in United States dollars with provision only for the least developed countries and countries whose national incomes represent less than 0.01 per cent of world income.
As indicated below, the Committee decided to present several alternatives accompanied by illustrative tables that show in detail the effects of the different approaches on individual rates of assessment and the scale as a whole.
1. General Assembly resolution 46/221 B
61. The Committee took as its point of departure General Assembly resolution 46/221 B. In the resolution, the Assembly refers to a 10-year statistical base period, uniform exchange rates, debt-adjusted income, a low per capita income allowance formula with a per capita income limit of the average world per capita income and a gradient of 100 per cent, a floor rate of 0.01 per cent and a ceiling rate of 25 per cent, a method for phasing out the scheme of limits over two scale periods that would also include provisions to avoid, to the extent possible, the allocation of additional points as a result thereof to developing countries, and maintaining the rates of the least developed countries at 0.01 per cent.
62. Some Committee members were of the view that the General Assembly, in paragraph 3 (b) (iii) of its resolution 46/221 B required the use of operational rates for the 22 Member States for the period prior to their admission to IMF and that the existing scheme of limits should be used for the next two scale periods without any modification before it is eliminated altogether.
An illustrative scale using a 1982-1991 base period and based on these criteria showing their step-by-step impact on the national income of Member States is contained in annex I below.
Some other members questioned whether annex I conformed with resolution 46/221 B with regard to the phasing out of the scheme of limits and the provision to avoid, to the extent possible, the allocation of additional points as a result thereof to developing countries.
63. Other members were, however, of the view that, in light of paragraph 3 (b) of General Assembly resolution 46/221 B, IMF exchange rates should be used for the 22 Member States for all years of the statistical base period 1982-1991.
In their opinion, in response to paragraphs 2 (a) and 3 (f) of that resolution, there were two possible methods for phasing out the scheme of limits.
The second method would involve the broadening of the scheme's parameters by 70 per cent and applying it once during the scale period.
It is comparable to column 3 of annex III A of the aforementioned report.
An illustrative scale using a 1982-1991 base period and based on these criteria showing their step-by-step impact on the national income of Member States is contained in annex II to the present report.
Some other members felt that annex II does not conform with resolution 46/221 B, in which IMF rates are to be used for IMF members and the scheme of limits is to be phased out avoiding allocation of points to developing countries.
2. Change in the statistical base period
64. In response to the discussion in paragraphs 52 and 53 above, some Committee members suggested the variation of the statistical base period as an alternative.
